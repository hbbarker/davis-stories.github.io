    <h1>Memories from Davis Children</h1>
    <p>This page contains a few memories the Davis children can recall from their time growing up. They are organized based on separate recollections that were sent by each individual.</p>

    <h2>Recollections from Camille Davis Mendel</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>First Recollection</h3></li>
        <h5>Added note by Ralph: "From moving to Texas in 1972 and then to The Hague, Netherlands in late 1979, we made quite a number of trips back to Utah to visit family. Here is a recollection from Camille about making those trips:"</h5>
            <p>Some of my fondest memories of childhood centered on our trips from Texas to Utah to visit our grandparents. We generally took these trips by vehicle, first in the old red station wagon and then later in an A-team style large van. We were a large family and traveling by car pre-digital age meant keeping small children happy and occupied so that dad could drive in peace.  A lot of credit goes to our dear mother who went to great lengths to keep us occupied and squabble free. I can remember her sewing a long and skinny pocket panel that she tied somehow to the side panel of the large open area in the back of the station wagon. This was the pre-seatbelt era and we kids would sit back there en masse and lay down and wrestle and carry on. But in this pocket panel each morning we would find a small gift for each of us. There were puzzles and travel size games, new crayons and small writing pads, maybe if we were really lucky a yo-yo or slinky. I don’t remember exactly, all I know is that mom would have something new and pristine for us to play with as we began the day. Dad was always a morning person so the day would begin very early. I can still remember the morning smells and distant sounds that would mingle in my sleepy head --the trucks, cool air, and gasoline as each of us would be gently carried to the car in our pjs with the hope that we would stay asleep and quiet for at least an hour of the early start. Dad would get down the highway an hour or two and then we would stop for breakfast, piling out of the station wagon to change into our play clothes and get pancakes at a Holiday Inn diner or something similar. The goal was always to find someplace that had packets of peanut butter to put on our pancakes, a habit that started young with all of us.</p>
            <p>As we transitioned to the van, dad would install a CB radio for the trip and would communicate with truckers who would tell us about traffic issues, or best of all warn us of “smokey bears” or “evel knievels” (policemen) up ahead.  I think our call sign was the “Texas turkeys”. On one trip dad managed to avoid policemen almost all the way home until perhaps 50 miles from home when he was pulled over for speeding. Dad and mom would quiz the older kids on how to spell names of cities we would pass through.  My favorite was Albuquerque. And I can still remember seeing my first McDonalds on the road and the sign that said over 500K hamburgers served.  What a small number that is now. It was always such a treat to take a turn in the front seat sitting next to dad. I can remember dad studying printed maps, but he rarely needed them for these trips because the route was in his head. Such fun memories.</p>

        <li><h3>Second Recollection</h3></li>
            <p>Another favorite destination as a child was Grandma and Grandpa Hank’s house. We spent Christmases and summer vacations at their home often during my younger years.</p>
            <p>I can remember that grandma Hank was always so crafty. For Christmas she would make enormous Christmas “stockings” out of large coffee cans. As a child those coffee cans could hold many treasures.  Christmas morning was always such an enchanting time because grandma’s entire living room would be full of presents. It was amazing for a child to wake up and see all of those gifts that Santa would leave and to think that he would find us at grandma’s house was even more impressive. I can remember listening to the radio which had a station that would track Santa through the states. It was so much fun to listen until we were shuffled off to bed. There was usually someone sick for Christmas morning. In my memory it was usually Brooke, but I’m sure there were others of us kids who got sick as well.</p>
            <p>Visiting grandma in the summertime was great too. We would often spend time fishing at the lake which is a memory for another entry, but the days that we would spend at grandma’s house were filled with memories of grandpa standing at the BBQ grill outside flipping burgers and us kids playing in the yard and rolling down his little hill in the back yard.  We would play night games with neighbor kids like kick the can and sometimes when the season was just right we would play a dodge ball type game with the small crabapples that grew on the trees near the house and grandpa would always holler at us to come in at 9 pm and if we were lucky we’d get an extra hour on weekend nights. I can also remember grandpa making his drinks in the late afternoon. I can still hear the ice tray coming out of the freezer. It was aluminum and had a lever that you pulled to break up the ice cubes, but if that didn’t completely do the job, grandpa would hit the ice with the back of a big spoon. Grandpa’s hands were a thing of beauty. They were always tanned and so big and his knuckles stood out. He wore his beautiful ring and I just thought they were amazing. Back in those days grandpa would work in the garage from time to time and I can remember that he wore a full piece coverall that was greasy and well worn. Now looking back on those memories as an adult, I’m sure that grandpa needed those drinks to tolerate all of us rowdy kids fighting and wrestling in his downstairs TV room. We did it so often that it was in his TV room that Kurt and I fought when he broke my arm. That was the summer that Cora got married because I had the cast on when I was one of her flower girls. I also remember wanting to stay awake so badly so that I could watch Johnny Carson with grandma and grandpa. I always loved hearing their commentary to whatever it was that Johnny was featuring that night. Another memory that I have of being at Grandma’s house was the summer that I had a very bad reaction to something I ate. I think it was nuts, but my whole mouth was covered in canker sores. It was so bad that I slept with my tongue hanging out. I was in so much pain and my tongue itself was swollen. This would be the first time but not the last that I would have a reaction to some mysterious element that my body would completely reject.</p>
            <p>I can also remember grandma teaching me how to crochet.  I was always impressed with her creativity.  Whether it was painting, dolls, or some type of stitching, grandma kept her hands busy.  She often went to classes for these crafts and now as an adult I can completely related to that desire to create and be busy.</p>
        
        <li><h3>Third Recollection</h3></li>
            <p>I have some random memories that have stuck in my brain about time spent with Grandma Don (Iris Scott)  as a young child. I can remember mom taking me to the Governor’s mansion to meet up with grandma. I can hear my shoes clicking on the stone floor and the big wide open space of some large room that we would enter. I remember grandma looking so chic and business like, her beautiful red hair all pulled up in a swooping bun on the back of her head. I remember driving up the canyon with her, the smell of Wrigley’s Spearmint gum masking the always present smell of cigarettes that she smoked back in those days. She would always share some with me but she liked to tear the stick in half and give me just half at a time. I remember always stopping at a Kmart that was close to the mouth of Parley’s canyon and getting snacks one of which was jello in the small square packages which she would let us (some of the time Kurt was with us) stick our fingers in and lick off. The dye making our fingers and our tongues blue, or purple. Perhaps I’m joggling these memories together in my brain, but I can still remember the drive up the final stretch of Summit Park and seeing their beautiful A Frame home on the left. In an earlier memory I can remember coming to the work site of this grand house that grandpa built and grandpa helping me hammer in a nail or two. Most likely I was just in the way but he made me feel like I was special.  I would sleep in the loft of the house and can remember the smell of coffee in the morning that would waft through the house.</p>
            <p>At some other time, grandma took Kurt and I to a national park. I believe it was Yellowstone.  Kurt and I would sleep in the top loft bed of the camper which always gave me claustraphobia. I would wake in the middle of the night feeling like I was being squished, not being able to breathe, probably crying. Those were the longest nights ever. I remember hiking around the park with them and watching the chipmunks play. Kurt and I would scramble far too close to drop offs and she and grandpa would scold us. Being in the outdoors and learning to fish all came from those early days of being with my grandma Don.</p>
            <p>Later as we got older, Grandpa Hank built us a lawnmower motor go kart. We would drag that thing up to Grandma Don’s canyon house and drive it up and down the hill. It didn’t go very fast and you could hear the engine struggling when we would go uphill, but ohhh did we have fun.</p>

        <li><h3>Fourth Recollection</h3></li>
            <p>These experiences took place in Houston where we moved when I was in first grade. We lived on Gessner Road in some apartments first and then eventually moved to a house on Wind River Dr. I guess all of these events happened sometime between 1974-1979. They were mom’s accident in the van coming home from Brynnley’s birthday party, the water tower explosion and the break-in of our home.</p>
            <p>I was sitting in the front seat of the van with mom driving and we were coming home from Brynnley’s birthday party with a van filled with her friends. The traffic was stop and go and I believe we were on  FM1960.  A large flatbread work truck slammed on his brakes and we couldn’t stop in time.  I remember the impact, the seatbelt snapping over my chest and my knee making a hole in the paneling between the two front seats.  It was silent when it first happened and then the girls in the van started crying.  Mom kept her cool, but she asked me to get out and find a telephone to call dad.  While I was doing this someone must have called the police and emergency vehicles.  The next thing I know we are riding to the hospital in the ambulance.  I was sitting up front in the ambulance if I remember correctly.  It’s crazy how the adrenaline flows through your body and your heart rate increases. I think that I’m super sensitive to traffic issues as a result of this experience.</p>
            <p>The next incident really impacted our whole family. It was Christmas time because my mother had already set up the decorations and we had put our tree up and there were gifts already under the tree probably from grandma and grandpa.  We were at home when it happened "all tucked up in our bedrooms fast asleep” but I can remember coming down the stairs and seeing muddy footprints on our living room carpeting.  The house had a double French door that opened up from the formal dining room and the thieves came in from that door.  They stole the gifts from under our tree and took my mother’s purse which she always left on top of the fridge in the kitchen.  They took our Television (which my parents decided not to replace right away, who needs a television anyway?).  The worst part about the whole event was trying to go to sleep the next night, laying in my bed imagining the thieves creeping around the house looking at us all while we slept, imaging them arguing with each other about which of us they were going to take as a hostage, and listening to the sounds of the house and wondering if they’d come back to take another look. It was unsettling to a young girl that is for sure.</p>
            <p>The final memory is a short but poignant one. I remember being tasked to watch my brothers and sisters for a couple of hours while my parents were out of the house and hearing a large explosion that rocked the whole house. Again a young girl’s imagination runs wild and I thought that the neighborhood was being invaded or that someone’s home just exploded and perhaps we were next. It turned out to be something with the water tower which was down the street near the neighborhood swimming pool.</p>

    <h2>Recollections from Brynnley Davis Pyne</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>First Recollection</h3></li>
            <p>I remember one of our drives to Utah in the Mercedes and i was sitting in the front with mom and i didn’t think she was paying attention and the car started swerving to the other lane and i grabbed the steering wheel to “save us” and it scared mom and she grabbed the wheel back and I think over corrected and we ended up in the ditch!! 😱. That was a sad day. I actually don’t remember what happened after that. Can someone finish the story? </p>
            <p>Here’s another one of my memories. I remember when we were living with gma and gpa hank and dad and the boys were living in Oregon. I missed dad so much. It was my 11th birthday and I remember I wasn’t allowed to get my ears pierced until I was 12. I was so irritated because I wanted them earlier. Well I got a gift from dad and when I opened it it was the most beautiful pair of amethyst stud earrings. I think I looked at mom with tears in my eyes, a little confused because I didn’t have holes to put them in and she told me I was going to get my ears pierced for my birthday. I was so excited!!</p>
            <p>I will also always treasure all of the concerts that I played in where I looked out and saw my family there cheering me on. I loved when the concert was over and I got to go find my family and get hugs and kisses and smiles because you all thought I did great. That always meant so much to me.</p>
            <p>A lot of my memories also growing up are of me and mom going back and forth to violin lessons or orchestra practice. Whether it was to Rotterdam where we would spend all of our Saturday to get there and back or driving to federal way eating my lunch in the car on the way. Mom was always there driving me to my lessons.</p>
