    <h1>Military Experiences</h1>
    <p>On December 4, 1963 I joined the 40th Aeromed Evacuation Squadron of the Air Force Reserve in Portland, Oregon with a commitment of 6 years of service. Here again as in one of the questions above, the answer to the question needs to be split into two time frames. The first time frame being “basic training” and the second time frame being “technical training”.</p>

    <h4>First time frame</h4>
    <p>Air Force recruits including reservists are required to undergo eight and a half weeks of basic training in San Antonio, Texas at Lackland AFB. This is the “processing week”. All the new recruits get haircuts and we were issued everything that we needed for basic training. That included combat boots, running shoes, leather gloves, a duffel bag, wool and cotton socks, two towels, a pair of sweatpants, two t-shirts, and some other essentials. We would also be assigned to a “flight” or unit that we would stay with during the entire time. We were assigned to a dorm and begin to learn drill procedures immediately.</p>

    <h4>A typical Day at basic training:</h4>
    <p>Although different training segments are introduced each week, the daily timeline stays pretty much the same.</p>

    <h4>Second Time Frame</h4>
    <p>In March, 1964 I was shipped off to Gunter AFB, Montgomery, Alabama for Medical Service Specialty Training. Life at the technical training duty assignment was much less intense than basic training. It was more like a technical college where each day we were in classes for 8 to 10 hours covering all aspects of our Medical Services Specialty training. We were given weekends off and were able to leave the base in desired for recreation or other more fun type activities.</p>

    <h4>What things from home did you miss the most while you were serving in the military?</h4>
    <p>The things from home that every soldier misses are the three “F’s” – food, family, and friends.</p>

    <h4>After you entered the military, what were your first thoughts upon arriving at your station and meeting your fellow soldiers?</h4>
    <p>My first thoughts upon arriving at my first duty station were along the lines of “what am I doing here”! The Air Force, not unlike the other branches of the military, brings together men and women of many different stripes. All of us new recruits were pretty wide-eyed and for the most part just wanted to fit in, be able to keep up, stay out of trouble, graduate, and be transferred to our technical assignments.</p>
