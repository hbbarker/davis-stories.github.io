    <h1>Marriage</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>How(and/or)Why did you decide to get married?</li></h3>
            <p>I fell in love with a very nice, tall and crazy handsome guy that I wanted to have babies, a home and a life with. Easy shmeezy!!!</p>

    <h1>Childhood</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Were your parents happy?</li></h3>
            <p>“Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn, or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience  of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.” Dinis Waitley</p>
            <p>If you were to ask my mother (Wanda Geraldean Kemp) to answer this question I wonder how she would respond. She was the 10th child of Harvey Alma Kemp and Gevienia Bullock Kemp.  They farmed land in Crescent, Utah, 20 miles south of Salt Lake City. Her mother suffered a stroke in her mid 50’s and died when Wanda was 12 years old. Most of her siblings were out of the family home by then, her father remarried soon after and life changed dramatically for this young teenage girl. She didn’t bond with her new step mother and her father, as were most men in his generation, not demonstrative in his show of affection. She dropped out of school at the age of 14 and worked domestically for a ‘well to do’ family in the area. She spoke affectionately of this family all though I don’t remember if she ever called them by name.</p>
            <p>She met my father, Karl Grover Shakespeare, in her early 20’s, they married in the summer of 1944, I was born in January,1945. A year later they were divorced. These and the many years that followed could not have been happy years for her. It could be said that the circumstances of her life before age 25 dictated some of the bad choices she made for the next several years. Foster care for me with occasional weekend visits would be her way of trying to make sense and work through those difficult years in her life.</p>
            <p>She met Henry Schouten sometime in the early 1950’s. He was also the youngest of 10 children. His parents were emigrants of The Netherlands. I can only imagine, listening to stories of those years, that he was quite the playboy. He lived with his mother (his father passed earlier) until he and my mom married in November 1952. He would have been in his early thirties. As a child my memory of him being happy only occurred when he was drinking but I know that’s not true. He tried hard to be a good step father, and in so many ways he was the best. He made my mom happy, we lived in a stable environment and he was a hard worker. He also quit school after the ninth grade, began working at the ‘Gas Company’ later it was ‘Mountain Fuel’ and then became ‘Questar’ where he would be employed until his retirement. It was clear throughout my life that he adored my mother and would certainly confess that being married to her was the best decision of his life. That alone was a recipe for happiness as well as becoming a father at the birth of my sister Cora. As a more mature adult I grew to love him in so many ways.</p>
            <p>The relationship with my biological father was complicated. Recently while listening to a CD of him tell the story of his life it was a revelation of the power of agency and the life altering consequences of our choices. He had what he would describe as a wonderful childhood marked by a close relationship with his own parents and grandparents. Except for the sorrow I think he honestly felt for turning his back on our relationship, I remember him mostly as being happy.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What were your favorite subjects in high school?</li></h3>
            <p>I love learning. I just didn’t realize it in high school. The teachers I liked the most were those who expected the best and supported your efforts with affirming compliments and positive critics. I liked history and remember an assignment from Mr. Rydalch to write a letter to an imaginary Russian penpal explaining why I loved democracy and what it meant to me personally. Then there was Mr. Higgins who taught biology. I loved it but never saw myself pursuing further education in the sciences. Mr. Higgins suggested it may be a waste of time and money to take the AP test. Although I did take the class and loved it. Problem was I wanted to major in sociology, not the science but the art of being social!</p>
            <p>At age 14 I discovered my love of the stage. I was in several plays, loved choir, was student body VP in middle school and a student body officer in high school which left little time for academia. However I do remember fondly Ms. Foster in high school who had a huge impact on my self esteem from one simple comment on a paper I wrote using the word ‘lilliputian’ to describe my station in life as a young child. From then on Mr. Thesaurus became my best friend in composition. In high school I left the stage and choir behind. It was kind of like being in the band, not a place to develop ‘coolness’, never mind that you really liked it.</p>
            <p>“I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught.”--Winston Churchill</p>
        
        <h3><li>What did you hide from your parents as a child?</li></h3>
            <p>The first thing that comes to mind happened in high school during my junior year. I’m sure if I thought about it long enough I could come up with some really naughty things, but why would I make them public?</p>
            <p>At the end of my junior year some friends convinced me to run for a student body office. I didn’t want to tell my parents, exposing myself to the humiliation of losing. It’s one thing to be a loser in front of friends but I didn’t want my parents to be disappointed in me if I lost. So a few  friends helped by making posters and handouts in their homes. The announcement was to be made on a Thursday night during an assembly in the school auditorium. I was participating somehow in the assembly so I convinced my parents to come. At the end of the assembly the winners would be announced and surprisingly I was on that list. I got a severe tongue lashing that night for not telling, but it was all in fun.</p>
            <p>Did I ever smoke a Marlboro at ten years old or drink a spiked eggnog at the Hamburger place where I once worked? Maybe. Did I ever smoke another cigarette or drink another spiked eggnog? The addictive nature of one cigarette was scary, even at 10. I think I did it once more, at the same place at the same time and that was it!. And the eggnog? I was at work and the two women I worked with made it strong and sweet. It only took a minute before the entire room was spinning around, I didn’t know if I was making chocolate milk shakes or grilled cheese sandwiches. I just wanted the spinning to stop so I could get off. It was a horrible feeling of being out of control. First and last time for both.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Which sports teams were you a fan of as a child?</li></h3>
            <p>The only professional sports team I remember as a child were the Salt Lake Bees, a farm league baseball team in SLC. Baseball was huge in those days, the ‘all American sport!’ Cheering for the LA Dodgers or NY Yankees during the Fall World Series was required viewing in neighborhoods across the country. Baseball was the most popular sport in the 50’s and 60’s while football had not yet gained popularity, especially in smaller cities.</p>
            <p>I remember attending a few baseball games at Derks Field when I was eight or nine. I loved being outside at night, smelling cigarette smoke, eating a hotdog and of course cheering for the hometown boys. Grandpa loved to tease me about having a crush on the guy that played shortstop. Fall was my favorite time of year and baseball had a lot to do with that.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What games did you play when you were young?</li></h3>
            <p>Outdoor play was a big deal growing up in the 50’s. Because we didn’t have the distractions of electronics, I remember long days spent entirely outside. I don’t remember many organized games before age 8. Hopscotch was the first game I remember around that age. All we needed was a piece of chalk, a taw and a few kids to make it fun. It was mostly girls, the boys were too cool to play silly games with girls. The pattern drawn on the sidewalk was very different from the 8 block game I see today on school grounds. Ours had a rounded top and an X pattern in the middle. The taw could be anything that would land flat when tossed. You could buy round rubber taws but the heel of a worn out shoe worked just as well, and it was free. Hide and seek was big, and marbles were also popular. It was played mostly by boys but occasionally they’d let me try. I didn’t have my own marbles and wasn’t sure of the rules, only that the eyes were the prettiest and the steely was the bully.  Now I probably have that all wrong because what do girls know about marbles anyway? I only remember that they were glass and very pretty.</p>
            <p>Around that same age I learned to play Canasta and other card games. My competitive nature could keep me engaged for hours. I still love games, especially those that are more interactive. In the fifth and sixth grade tetherball was the hot sport on the playground. I must admit I was dang good at wrapping that ball around the pole. I was clearly in my 20’s before I realized that the soccer we played on the baseball field was not really soccer at all. We played it like baseball. The person on the pitcher mound would roll the basketball ball as fast as they could to the kicker, the kicker would kick it and run the bases. You were out if the ball hit you or rolled in front of you while running. In those years girls may have been able to run faster than boys, beat them in tetherball, baseball, soccer, basketball or track but girls were not playing organized, competitive sports. That would be so unlady-like to get all red in the face and smelly! When we did play organized basketball we only played on half court (and tried not to sweat) :) </p>
        
        <h3><li>When did you get your first car?</li></h3>
            <p>Awe, my first car, lovingly referred to as ‘the competition coup’. If you google 1960 plymouth coups, there are some crazy, good looking cars, my CC would not be among them.  Mine was spearmint green, no back seat and the previous driver was a chain smoker 👍 but… I fixed it up and now wish I had a picture to show, stay with me. I needed a car to get back and forth from the U and my job.</p>
            <p>Hank said that his boss was selling his company car and thought I could pick it up for a good price. He was right, $100 cash! I went to the bank the next day, yes, I had to take out a loan, filled out the papers and agreed to pay the bank $25 a month, I was ecstatic!</p>
            <p>No back seat? No problem, we had 2 fold up lawn chairs, the kind with the criss cross webbing, green and white, perfect! The smell? Well that was a little harder. I washed the vinyl seats and floor mats with a mixture of ammonia and clorox, a deadly combination that ate the skin right off the tips of my fingers. By now the tobacco smell turned into something unrecognizable, nothing that a cheap bottle of cologne from FW Woolworths could not correct. The transmission was a stick shift, I didn't mind. And seatbelts? Who ever heard of such a thing?</p>

        <h3><li>How would your parents have described you?</li></h3>
            <p>As wonky (Preoccupied with arcane details or procedures) but basically good. They really didn't know how good and easy I was until Cora became a teen 😂</p>
        
        <h3><li>What sports did you like most as a child? Why?</li></h3>
            <p>I didn't like professional sports except for baseball in the Summer/ Fall</p>
            <p>I liked jump rope, skating, hopscotch, tetherball, softball</p>
        
        <h3><li>What were you like in high school?</li></h3>
            <p>High school was probably more social than scholastic. It was something we had to do but being with friends made it fun. That was my attitude in the beginning, maybe all through 10th grade. The social life never lessened but I did value the satisfaction of getting good grades and working hard. I do see more clearly now that developing social and leadership skills are at least as important as scholarship in secondary education.</p>
            <p>I think my childhood made me kinder, always looking for the person eating alone, feeling left out or new at school.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What store or restaurant did you love to go to as a child?</li></h3>
            <p>I loved and have wonderful memories of the F.W. Woolworth Stores. They were one of many five and dime stores at the time and clearly the most popular. We had one in Kearns that I visited often but my first memories were sometime around my 12th year. I had earned money babysitting and wanted a pair of slip-on shoes with taps on the heels. Very very popular in Jr high school, but expensive. We were in Kearns by now but I knew where to catch the bus that would take me downtown to SLC for the big Woolworth store where I could find those slip-on shoes for one dollar and caps at the same store (the caps were metal and  as you walked the clapping noise sounded cool and expensive). The shoes were $1 a pair, with caps $1.15 and Hank hammered them on the heels when I got home. I remember singing in my mind these lyrics to a little popular song, “we’re in the money, the sky is sunny, We’ve got a lot of what it takes to get along!” That day I also sat at the counter and bought my first hamburger, the most delicious burger that I've ever eaten to this very day!</p>

        <h3><li>Were you ever teased about anything as a child?</li></h3>
            <p>From age 5 to 10 I probably went to every elementary school in Salt Lake City and fell behind scholastically from the beginning. In addition I have dyslexia which was undiagnosed in those days and definitely misunderstood. Reading time in elementary school was done in small groups and when it was my turn to read I froze. Trying hard not to cry I stumbled through a sentence or two until the teacher called on someone else. I just thought I was dumb and kids can be cruel. I remember another occasion, probably 1st grade when the teacher asked everyone who couldn't spell their last name to stay in from recess for additional help. I was one of maybe 3 or 4 kids, it was Shakespeare for peat sake!</p>
            <p>There was such a stigma around divorce in the 50’s, I felt it from adults as well as my school playmates. When asked by a teacher or friend I would simply say my parents were separated. It just seemed softer and more hopeful I guess than the big D and trying to explain why I didn't live with either parent.</p>
            <p>There was also good natured teasing about boyfriends or hairdos. My cousin George would say this little ditty:</p>
            <p>“Judy puddy puddin pie, kissed the boys and made them cry 
                When the boys came out to play, Judy puddy ran away”  ???( makes no sense!)</p>

        <h3><li>What was your favorite memory of school? (at any age)</li></h3>
            <p>As a student body officer in high school we were invited by the local popular teen radio station to talk about upcoming events at our school. It was an effort I’m sure to improve ratings but they invited all the local high schools, one week at a time, to come and be interviewed. At the end of the interview the announcer said he liked my voice, would I like to record a station break? OKaaa. Here it is for your enjoyment: “Hi, this is Judy and you're listening to KNAK, Salt Lake City Utah.” That was the beginning and the end of my radio career. I did hear it a few times however, you'd be surprised to know I wasn’t compensated.</p>

    <h1>Raising Children</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>What are your favorite memories of each of your children growing up (or of them collectively)?</li></h3>
            <p>Camille, <b>angel child number one</b> taught her Dad and myself so much. With no instruction manual, guarantees or experience we were off on the adventure of a lifetime. I often asked her if she was the mom or was it me? Seriously! Even as a young child she seemed wise beyond her years. She liked books more than dolls, being the teacher at play and not the student, and was the best big sister ever, even though her brothers thought she was a little bossy at times. She slept through the night from the time we came home from hospital, mastered getting out of her crib before one year and was potty trained by 18 months. By now I’m thinking this parenting thing is a piece of cake. Her one insecurity as a small child it seemed, happened whenever we got in the car to go anywhere. She would ask if we had to go on the freeway? For some reason I could never understand, she would cry if the answer was yes.</p>
            <p>Piano was an instrument I had hoped that all of our children would learn to play and to love. Our dear friends the Delemar’s gave us an old upright piano when we lived in Houston and Camille being the oldest was endowed with the responsibility of beginning that process. She picked it up right away. I remember her discipline (at only 12 years old) of setting her alarm every school day at 5 AM to practice before school. Her teacher was French and required that dedication which I would say made her highly qualified but not very popular. Recitals, as they can be, were the most difficult days of the year. That sweet little girl literally got sick to her stomach. But not too sick for ice cream after.</p>
            <p>At age 14 and just beginning high school, our family left Houston, Texas for a job in the Netherlands. It was a difficult time to leave friends and familiar surroundings. Again our dear friends the Delamar’s threw out the welcome mat for her to live with them for those high school years if we agreed. We left the decision to her but only after she had given it her best effort for six months. I think she would agree that those years living abroad and experiencing different cultures was the best decision of her young life. She excelled academically, athletically and socially.</p>
            <p>The American School of The Hague sponsored the model United Nations every four years. Students from all over Europe and England were invited to participate. This is a picture of student leadership that year taken after Camille presented Queen Julianna of The Netherlands with flowers. Traveling from country to country to participate in sports and other activities kept us on the go in those years and Camille seemed to excel in every event.</p>
        
            <p>Kurt, <b>angel child number two</b> joined our family three years after Camille. Again with no instructions or guarantees. He was a beautiful baby with olive skin and big brown eyes. We lived on the avenues in SLC and in July, his birth month, it’s hot and we didn’t have air conditioning. I remember for some crazy reason our neighbor saying she knew he was a boy because of his voice. We had tried for a long time to get pregnant and I remember how blessed I felt to be his mother when he finally got here. Grandpa Shakespeare visited him once when he was a few weeks old. He was proud to count him as his 10th grandchild. Recently the thought that he was there when Kurt left mortality has brought comfort to me.</p>
            <p>Kurt as an infant liked to eat and on his own schedule, it didn’t take long to figure out that parenting was not going to be a piece of cake after all. Culturally the sixties began ushering in the idea that  boys were boys and girls were girls not because they were born with those innate  characteristics but because they were taught to behave as female or male. The evidence right before my eyes disputed that nonsense when I saw our 9 month old son pushing a hair brush around the kitchen floor making the noise of a car. It seemed such a boy thing to do.  At the age of nine months he was also walking and exploring everything as he demonstrated early in life his natural athletic abilities. He also played basketball while living in The Netherlands and I remember the first sports camp we signed him up for. It was in Switzerland and before his first games after arriving, he broke his wrist and ended up coming home early. I remember Kurt at  age of 3 and Camille age 6 taking an older wooden highchair apart screw by screw and putting it back together again, as this amazed mommy looked on.</p>
            <p>At 7 years old he had his first little league tryouts and we would later find out there was some serious jockeying going on between couches trying to get Kurt on their team specifically at the position of shortstop. He was a natural and loved the sport his entire life. He played third base in high school, was the team’s heavy hitter, and coached for many years after. He had a particular talent for languages as well, both writing and speaking and had us in stitches switching from one accent to another in the same conversation. As talented as he was he was also shy, making our move from Europe back to the US difficult in those teenage years.</p>
            <p>He would be quick to tell you that his greatest accomplishment where he found the sweetest joy, was being a father to Brett and Emma and later the step father of Gustavo, Tiago and Edwardo.</p>

            <p>Three years later Ryan, <b>our third angel child</b> joined our family, our first blonde blue eyed baby. We were still living on the avenues while Ralph finished an MBA program at the UofU. We lived in a ward with a majority of older, single women and college age students. Those older women loved Ryan. When they would see him standing on the benches at church before he was a year old however, I would get reprimanded for letting him stand at all. Didn’t I know that he could develop crooked legs from standing up too early? Well his legs turned out just fine. He played baseball and  soccer through middle school, learned to ski in the alps of Austria, and loved the outdoors. Ryan, maybe more than his siblings, loved to travel and always found adventure in the many places we visited. I remember the time we told the family we wanted to take a quick weekend  trip to Denmark, did anyone want to go with us? Ryan and Camille were the only two that wanted to go on this last minute adventure! We had a ball at Tivoli Gardens theme park where we had our first experience on a ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ type ride, we went multiple times. It was supposedly the place that inspired Walt Disney himself to open a theme park.We also visited LegoLand.</p>
            <p>I remember him coming home from school, maybe the sixth or seventh grade with a newly rented saxophone and so excited about learning to play. He had a jazz song memorized as did the entire family within days as he played it over and over. I could see the positive effect of music in this life. I would say he had a gift for music, but for sports as well which eventually won out.</p>
            <p>As a mother I would say that among Ryan’s many talents, being a loyal friend would be high on that list. If you were lucky enough to be his friend he would stand by you through thick and thin and all his friends knew that as well. Many of them have experienced the world together in the great outdoors and he would tell you that this is the place where one goes to reconnect and recharge our lives.</p>

            <p>Then came Brynnley, <b>our fourth Angel baby</b>. It’s February 7th, 10:30 at night I was folding the last batch of laundry in our two bedroom apartment. While matching the last pairs of colored socks I remember folding Ralphs and thinking he got the short end of the stick for attention. My life seemed overwhelmed with the task of matching socks, feeding hungry tummies and wiping runny noses and bums. In that moment of what now seems like misplaced melancholy I realized I was experiencing very close contractions. So close in fact that  by the time we arrived at the hospital the process was well under way and three pushes later she was here!!  She greeted me with a smile, some may say not possible but I will tell you she smiled at me. I got the distinct impression that we knew each other before that night.</p>
            <p>I have 3 distinct memories of Brynnley while living in Houston. First she was opinionated and feisty from the beginning. But charming and conciliatory as well. I don’t remember the offense, only that she had earned a timeout after failed negotiations. When crying didn’t get the results she wanted, she positioned herself on the floor by the closed door of the bathroom and kicked for several minutes. Oh, did I mention this was in the middle of the night? Negotiating with a 3 year old in the middle of the night may look like different things to different people but for this sleep deprived mom I was ready to promise her anything. It may have been Christmas shopping the next day, just the two of us, I can’t remember but I do remember that event close to the same time.</p>
            <p>I took each child out separately to buy a gift for the sibling whose name they had pulled from a hat. I just remember how thoughtful she was about everything she considered.  She would pick it up, think about it and go on to something else until her perfect selection had been made. It was about that same time I also remember her wanting to help make bread and my thought that those tiny hands covered in flour looked like porcelain to me. I’ve never forgotten how I felt at that moment.</p>
            <p>She has always loved music and from an early age could sing in perfect pitch. Wanting to help develop that gift a friend suggested the violin. We began lessons with the Suzuki method requiring an adult to learn the violin along with the child. Well that didn’t last long, by week three she was so far ahead of me that I returned my violin. It was apparent that she was the one with the musical gift, not me!</p>
            <p>I have fond memories of the two of us traveling by train to Rotterdam when she played in the Rotterdam Youth Symphony while living in the Netherlands. One night after a late practice in Rotterdam we took a tram to the train station, rode the train to Den Haag station and then a tram ride home to Scheveningen. It was 11:30 PM before we reached our last stop, but this little sleepy eyed, red headed musician never made a fuss. I remember to this day how I felt that night, safe in this environment and blessed to be her Mom.</p>

            <p>Two years later <b>our fifth angel baby</b> Brooke joined our family. Because Brynnley’s birth was quick and easy, at the first sign of labor we rushed to the hospital only to find out that her grand entrance wasn’t even close. We joke all the time that it was her beautifully round big head that caused the process to be so difficult, but we always finish the account with this true story: the nurse told us she had worked in the hospital for more than 20 years and had never seen a more beautiful newborn.</p>
            <p>In the days before ultrasound we didn’t know the sex of the baby until birth but I had a strong impression at about 7 months that we were having a girl and her name would be Brooke Janell which is the name on her birth certificate. Later however we discussed giving her the middle name of Ralph’s grandmother ‘Beata’ Snow. While we had not agreed upon changing her name, when Ralph gave her a fathers blessing and name at church he said that she would to be known upon the records of the church as Brooke Janell Beata Davis. I’m glad he did!</p>
            <p>Brooke was the perfect fit in our growing family. She loved her siblings, cousins, friends, pets and her dolls. She was a little shy but that never stopped her from reaching out to the child on the playground that was alone or needed a friend. She was the first in the family to be fluent in Dutch and would often bring friends home from Dutch pre school, some who spoke Dutch, some English, but she never had a problem going back and forth speaking both languages. Her best friend in those days was Suzanne from Sugarland, Texas. They sang and danced together for a school talent show to the tune of Uptown Girl, Billy Joel would have been proud.</p>
            <p>Friends were not the only things Brooke brought home. She was famous in the family for bringing home stray animals! Cats, an Iguana with a broken tail, a rabbit rescued from the wild and dogs with fleas. She loved them all and was especially broken-hearted when we had to return the bunny to his home in the wild before leaving the Netherlands. She has a talent for loving and caring for everything the breaths, a friend to everyone, including her now 40+ chickens and plans for other farm animals.</p>
            <p>Brooke had a few ‘best’ girl friends in her school days but much preferred hanging with boys.  They were not as dramatic or emotional about unimportant things, she was never into the drama. She was also athletic, playing basketball and running cross country, and was really good at both. She loves being outdoors whether hiking, fishing or telling stories around a campfire, it’s truly her domain. Not sure why but airplanes are coming to mind, so I’ll take a stab. I remember a prom date with a nice guy Brooke worked with at Paul's pet store. I think he took her flying before the dance, romantic! And then there was a boy she met on a flight from SLC to Seattle coming home from BYU between semesters.</p>

            <p>Jaime was our <b>sixth angel baby </b> and third Texas girl. How do I describe this darling person who had a hard time deciding exactly where and when she wanted to make her grand entrance into mortality? Finally the doctor said let's get this show on the road, bring on the Pitocin, and it worked, I mean I worked and she worked, and this beautiful baby girl blessed our family with love and talent and humor that never ends. We were able to stay in the hospital a few days, which is such a blessing when it's the sixth baby in a family. We needed that alone time together before the on slot of five adoring siblings. She was quiet and observant for a newborn, almost as though she understood what was ahead and took advantage of the stillness that prevailed in a hospital room. I loved the alone time as well and wondered what this new little miracle would bring to our family.</p>
            <p>Not surprising, the quietness ended in the hospital, she discovered her voice and was it ever cute. Her tonsils were larger than normal causing her to have this adorable low, raspy voice. She was confident, forward and had her own style from a very early age. We called her Punky Brewster after a sitcom character that also had a unique way of dressing and communicating. I remember a time while living in the Netherlands  when the family gathered together to make a cassette tape to send to Camille at BYU. Everyone was shy to speak into that little microphone but not Jaime. She offered to be the spokesperson for everyone in the room, ‘here I’ll say it for you’ she said to us all!</p>
            <p>Not quite as cute but forward nevertheless was the birthday gift from Nellie, our Dutch American Grandma. It was a homemade birthday card and in her presence Jaime looked at it and simply said, ‘Oh I hate this!’ I smile every time I think of those days.</p>
            <p>Also athletic, Jaime was kamikaze on the ski slopes in Austria where she first learned to ski. One day in the beginner class, that was all she could take. No holding on to the rope for her. Second day she was snow plowing down the hills without poles. I think she was on the lifts the third day. She also loved basketball and although she was shorter than many of the girls she was fast, enthusiastic, a team player and got off some really good shots. Now it’s the outdoors, the trails, the beauty of God's creations and eagles that speak of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Jaime has always had a gift to make things beautiful, this would not be music on the violin however. Four or five lessons with Mr Schbol pulling on her ear and the violin went back to the music store, giving up my dreams of a musical quartet. But what she does make beautiful are rooms, the environment, family, and relationships. She is compassionate, spiritual, kind and intuitive. She knows how to tune in and tune out, which is important in the craziness we’re all exposed to today.</p>

            <p>And for the grand finale we have Joseph Micheal, the <b>seventh angel baby </b> who’s overarching mentality has always been if you’re going to do something involving physicality, do it big! Weighing in10.5 lbs at birth, in a hospital in Den Haag was just the beginning. The nurses in the nursery  nicknamed him ‘the all American boy’ and took such good care of him. Because of complications from a messed up C-section, we enjoyed 2 weeks in the Rode Kruis Ziekenhuis to get acquainted. It was spring and we had a lovely view of the yellow forsythia blooming outside our window. It’s always a reminder of that occasion when forsythia are in bloom every spring.</p>
            <p>I remember the sweet little blanket that Camille crocheted for his homecoming. I can’t imagine a child having more adoring eyes on him than Joey did as a baby. The real trouble began when he became mobile. Even before he could walk he had a hairline fracture of the tibia and multiple stitches in his chin, which he always managed to remove before the chin healed. Unless you know the rest of the story you may wonder just who was watching this rambunctious baby boy. His life would be filled with broken bones, stitches and surgeries.</p>
            <p>Recognizing his need to be active, he got his first pair of roller skates at age 3.  Not the clamp on wheels that go over the shoe but actual shoe skates. He was quite the head turner while speeding along the sidewalks of Scheveningen at such a young age.  People thought he was in training for the Dutch Olympic Skate Team, well maybe. He turned enough heads! I wish we still had those little skates.</p>
            <p>He wanted to play football but his career ended before it even got started. While waiting for Ralph to sign him up he was climbing a tree, fell out and broke his wrist. That was the end of  his football career.</p>
            <p>Not sure his age when he began skiing but it seemed that every trip to the mountains in winter ended with a trip to the doctor for stitches. Kiddingly we told him before a trip to the slopes that if he got hurt and it required stitches, it was on his dime. Sure enough he came home with the second worst gash that I remember in his shin. He’s getting ready to show it to me and says “I think I just need a butterfly bandage”. That would be the joke for years to come! Keith Criddle met us in his office (it was Saturday) with Carole Lee to assist and that gash went all the way to the bone. The injury of all injuries however happened in Canada when the binding came off and the ski smacked him in the face causing an orbital fracture. Grateful for good goggles and doctors that put orbital fractures back together. Thankful also for Jenny D who accompanied me to Whistler that day to bring him home. I thought I would pass out when he took his dark glasses off. On the lighter side he had to finish an Eagle Scout project while calling on friends for support with a rubber hose hanging from his nose!</p>

        <h3><li>How did you figure out how to be a parent?</li></h3>
            <p>I don’t know, I think we're still trying to figure it out. It's the only really important job that requires a lot of ‘on the job’ training. Those adorable children come with no instruction manual, and just when you feel like you’ve got it all figured out with the first one, three years later number two proves you wrong.</p>
            <p>I've had amazing mentors and sought out friends who were comfortable and experienced nurturers and as a young mom that was very helpful. Everyone seems to have a theory and we can find a plethora of parenting books written by so-called ‘experts’. I've read many of them. The other challenge sometimes is finding a solution that both parents can agree on. We’ve both brought different experiences into a new family environment and we don’t always agree. There were a few experiences that taught me one very important lesson when it comes to parenting, and that is the importance of prayer.</p>
            <p>One Friday night our teenager came home after spending several hours at a teen club in Wassenaar with friends. In the beginning it was a hard transition connecting with a friend group while living in a foreign country. It’s late, Ralph is out of town but I’m not worried because a parent will drop our child off once the club closes at 11 pm. I heard the front door open and this message,  "I’m home and tired, see you in the morning”. Worried mom waits several minutes then feels a prompting to check in on this person she loves more than life. Asleep? Perhaps but probably not. She bends over checking the breath, gives a kiss on the forehead and whispers ‘I love you” then drops to her knees at the end of the bed and  pleads for wisdom she can not find on her own. Before she goes to sleep that night the answer is crystal clear.</p>
            <p>I pondered for a long time that night the  question of why that answer came so quickly when answers to other prayers have taken a detour or been lost in space for days, weeks, sometimes years? Then this answer came, 'these are my children in your charge’. All the mentors,  the ’how to’ books, the  relationships, while they can be helpful no one knows the answers to important family relationships like heaven does. The inspired message that night was  that God knows this is the most important responsibility we’ll ever have and the doors and windows to heaven are always open!</p>
        
        <h3><li>How did you decide when to have children? </li></h3>
            <p>Really? As soon as we got pregnant with Camille!</p>
            <p>Okay I know it's different now but we never considered waiting for children. Ralph had a good job and at the time continuing our education was not part of the plan. Three years later those plans changed. While he was working for a pharmaceutical company selling to doctors offices, he decided he'd rather be on the other side of those calls. So we sold our first home in Portland Oregon, packed up our belongings and we three headed to SLC for Ralph to continue his  schooling at the UofU in the fall of 1968.</p>
            <p>There were complications surrounding Camille's birth and our plan of spacing our family 2 years apart turned into three. Kurt joined us in 1968 and before Ralph graduated in 1972 with an MBA we had Ryan. Brynnley was our first baby post grad school and we decided if we were going for 7 (some random number???) we had to speed things up. Brooke joined our family in the patriotic year 1976, Jaime on her own terms in 1978 (all in Houston, Texas) and Joseph Michael  (the grand finally) in 1980 (The Netherlands) Everyone a gift and a blessing!</p>

        <h3><li>What are some of your special talents?</li></h3>
            <p>Still waiting for mine to appear. I don’t dance, sing, tell a good story or joke. I think I'm a good listener and I genuinely love people.</p>
            <p>I’m not an artist but I love decorating a pretty room. I like to cook but my efforts produce fairly mediocre results. Sometimes I get lucky. I’m bossy, not sure if that qualifies? I'm inspired by all kinds of music. Music can instantly change my mood, and I am so thankful for those who have a talent to create beautiful music, it's a gift to humanity.</p>
            <p>I'm asking for that talent in my next life :)</p>
        
        <h3><li>What foods do you dislike? Have these changed over time?</li></h3>
            <p>I love food! Most everything if prepared well. Not so as a child however. I didn't like canned veggies, (except for corn and green beans) and that's mostly what we ate with a meat serving and potatoes. I know potatoes are vegetables but they were not canned and it was hard to mess up a good potato. As a child we never ate spinach, brussel sprouts or any fresh greens, except for salads with iceberg lettuce. I also couldn't stand sweet potatoes, yams or pineapple but that has changed over the years. I discovered it was more a stringy texture thing that made me gag. I love them both now. I dont like wild or raw meat and stay away as much as possible from raw fish because of mercury.</p>
            <p>I remember with fondness Nanny Ingelbe’s lima beans with a little ham and homemade white bread. It makes me hungry thinking about it. Sometimes at night before bed we could have the stale white bread broken up in a bowl with milk and a little sugar on it. Yummy!</p>
        
        <h3><li>Have you ever sued someone, or been sued by someone?</li></h3>
            <p>Refer to Ralph</p>
        
        <h3><li>Are you superstitious?</li></h3>
            <p>I was superstitious in childhood. Step on a crack, break your mothers back, things like that. Not anymore.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Have you ever sleep-walked or sleep-talked, or done anything unconsciously? </li></h3>
            <p>I do remember doing both as a child. One time specifically, right after we were a family living on the 3rd Ave in SLC we had a fish tank with a very scary snake-like fish. I had bad dreams about that fish and one night I walked to the tank in my sleep and started rambling about that fish. My mom woke me up and walked me back to the bed. There were other occasions of sleep walking but it ended before my teen years (I think).</p>
            <p>Ralph will tell you that I often carry on conversation in my sleep but most alarming to him are my nightmares. I’ll share one. It wasn't long after we were married, living in our new home with hardwood floors throughout the house. I distinctly saw a rather large man standing at my bedside in the middle of the night. He was dressed in black, had his arm raised with a knife in his hand and was ready to bring that hand down and kill me! I was getting out of the way as quickly as possible and had to go over Ralph to do it. The bed rolled on those slick floors and he and I both went flying out of bed onto the floor. Poor Raph had no idea what hit him. I still have nightmares but none as physical as that one.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What are your favorite plays?</li></h3>
            <p>I don’t have favorite plays but I love Broadway musicals. Here are a few; Les Miserable, musical and book;  Phantom Of The Opera, Wicked, My Fair Lady, Newsies, West Side Story, The Music man, Joseph And The Amazing Colored Dreamcoat, Fiddler on The Roof, to name a few.</p>
            <p>I've also learned to appreciate Shakespeare, here a few favorites: Hamlet; A dark tale of revenge, where a prince succeeds in avenging his fathers death, but at a terrible cost. Much Ado About Nothing; Much lighter than most of Shakespeare's plays where he mixes bitterness with comedy and is full of twists, turns and tricks. Othello; A drama about human frailties and a reminder of the destructive power that can be awakened in us all.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What qualities do you most value in your better half?</li></h3>
            <p>If you mean my Ralphy, I was so impressed with his gentlemanly habits. He was taught well by a mother who valued what we might call today outdated and maybe even sexist. Things like opening the car door, walking on the sidewalk closest to the road in case water or debris was splashed on the sidewalk from a passing car. Helping a woman with her coat or pulling out a chair in a restaurant to seat you first. In later days following those polite gestures I admit my woman's lib indoctrination made those sweet gestures a little irritating but now I wait on those moments to be treated with such love and respect. I hope my Sons and Grandsons will follow their Dad/Grandfather Davis and treat the women in their lives with that respect. And to my Daughters and Granddaughters, expect and honor it!</p>
            <p>I also love that he is kind and willing to give others the benefit of the doubt, innocent until proven guilty. That extends in a large degree to the crazies on Utah highways and that's big!!!</p>
            
        <h3><li>What is one of the most beautiful places you've ever been?</li></h3>
            <p>{I think grandpa is an overachiever on this one :) } Truth is I could say ditto to all those amazing places we’ve been so blessed to visit. The architecture, art museums, churches and the beauty of nature itself have been so awe inspiring to this girl who until age 19 had never been more than 100 miles outside Salt Lake City. Let me begin there.</p>
            <p>Before landing in Portland, Oregon to meet my soon to be father-in-law, Vernon Davis, his wife Francie and half brother Steven, I couldn’t imagine there were so many shades of green. The downtown city of Portland has rivers running through it and every neighborhood looked like a mountain retreat. All of that beauty paled however when for the first time the view of the Pacific ocean was in sight. The wonder of such a massive body of water moving in rhythmic cadence was mesmerizing. The high and low tides governed by the gravitational pull of the moon, the ratio of water to land mass, so many questions. That night as the sun slowly disappeared into that massive body of water I wanted everything to stop in that moment so as to etch it permanently in my mind. I never wanted to forget the feelings of that night. There’s a reverence in the creative process of our Heavenly Parents that calls us to pause, to be still and know that the divine authorship of such beauty, such goodness and love belong to them.</p>
            <p>“I go to nature to to be soothed and healed and to have my senses put in order” John Burroughs</p>
            <p>The day before our wedding in late September 1964, would be a day never to be forgotten. Spending my childhood not knowing my father or two half siblings left me curious about their existence. I made up stories and created fantasies of meeting them in unlikely places under unusual circumstances. None of those stories or fantasies could ever match what really happened that evening in the Salt Lake Temple prior to our wedding the next day.</p>
            <p>We arrived early that evening and while Ralph was asking for information on where to go next I waited in the lobby for aunt LaVer and uncle Joe Kemp to arrive. They would be our escorts for that session. I was nervous and excited at the same time. The next day I would marry the man of my dreams. It was busy in the small temple lobby that night but I noticed a man in the crowd with a scarred face and my immediate thought was that this man could be my brother. I was always looking for missing family in crowds of people. I didn’t think about it again, I had marriage on my mind. This night was not the time to recreate fantasies from childhood but to look ahead at a beautiful bright future.</p>
            <p>Near the end of the session one of the sweet temple workers approached me for clarity that I was indeed the Judy Shakespeare who would be sealed the next day to my sweetheart. She told me there was another Judy Shakespeare in that same session who was there as an escort for another couple going through the temple for the first time. Was this really happening? I turned around to look at the man seated on the other side of the room and there he was, the  man with the scarred face looking back at me! In the celestial room. In the Salt Lake temple that night I met my brother Dennis for the first time that I could remember in one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been, and neither of us knew the other would be there. I’m convinced however that heaven knew and answered the soft spoken prayers of a broken child who longed for connection.</p>
            <p>“The temple is a point of intersection between heaven and earth. In this sacred place, holy work will be performed through selfless service and love. The temple reminds us of all that is good and beautiful in the world” David A Bednar</p>
            <p>While any judgment of beauty is subjective, here are a few unusual places that make my list: hospital rooms in Portland Oregon, Salt Lake City Utah, Houston Texas, and Den Haag, The Netherlands. In every instance those sterile rooms were transformed into hallowed spaces where heaven and earth would meet. More than once on bended knees, on cold tile floors, prayers of gratitude went heavenward for the miracle of birth. Those rooms are indelible in my mind, not for the physical beauty but for the births of eternal relationships that continue to teach and refine. Each birth is unique as the child is delivered, each birth a reminder of a sacred connection.</p>
            <p>“I could not get my fill of looking! There should be a song for women to sing at this moment or a prayer to recite because there are no words strong enough to name the moment.” Anita Diamont</p>
            <p>If a hospital room is tagged a most beautiful place at the birth of a child can it also be said at the death of a loved one? Again all in the eye of the beholder.</p>
            <p>This room was sunny, cohabited and therefore busy. It was my second dad Hank Schouten, who lay in the hospital bed in and out of consciousness. We had already been informed that sepsis would take his life within the next 24 hours. When he awoke to communicate with us his primary concern was his need for the pants that hung in the wash room at home. He needed them because he was going on a trip, the brown or blue ones, it didn’t matter he said he just needed to get dressed. When asked where he was going he responded that he wasn’t sure but he didn’t want to miss the plane. He asked if I wanted to go? Maybe it was San Francisco he said but he needed those pants. He would doze momentarily and then wake up to inquire again about the pants.The days prior he would tell of dreams involving his brothers and sister who had passed years before and of beautiful animals and flowers, the likes of which he had never seen before. My sweet Mom sat in a fog wondering what the next week would look like.</p>
            <p>As evening approached they moved him to a private room and invited us to stay as long as we wished. My sister Cora came in after work, and she and our Mom left after dark that evening.</p>
            <p>I stayed with him that entire night in a room with no windows or furnishings, once again in a place that was transformed into a hallowed and sacred chamber. As he transferred from this life to another, I had so much I wanted to tell him. I talked to him that entire evening, seated by his side, pacing the floor and sometimes whispering in his ear. I wanted him to know how in my adult years I had grown to love him and how much our relationship meant to me.</p>
            <p> I thanked him for how much he loved and even idolized my mother and how happy he made her. Being a grandfather was perhaps his greatest title and he should know how much his grandchildren loved him. Many other words of praise and gratitude were expressed while feeling in my heart that even without responses, he knew I was there and loved him with all my heart. My last words to him were a reminder of a conversation we had a few years earlier when he asked me if I really believed there was something beyond this earth life where our departed loved ones would be. I assured him unequivocally that life continues with our loved ones beyond what we know here, and that there is a God who loves us all unconditionally.</p>
            <p>For my sweet Mom the experience, also in the hospital, was different but no less spiritual. She spent 6 weeks in an ICU unit in the same hospital as my dad ten years earlier. While prayers went heavenward for her recovery I was grateful for the many hours spent by her side as she drifted in and out of wakefulness. My same expressions of gratitude and love for her and for what she had learned throughout a lifetime of difficult experiences were expressed. She had pneumonia and for a few good weeks it looked as though she would recover.</p>
            <p>However the ravenous effects of the illness left her body weak and unable to fight back when even minor symptoms returned. In those moments of quietness, beside her sleeping frame I felt surrounded by angels ready to take her home. We informed the family and each child and grandchild made an effort to be with her in those final moments. Brooke and baby Stella were the last to arrive from Seattle. When Brooke entered the room Stella made a little fuss and Mom made a movement and sound as though recognizing that they were there. Brooke said “I feel like she’s going to a big party and there’s a welcoming committee waiting to celebrate and we’re not invited.” Perfect assessment of the moment! As our little family unit surrounded her bedside that night I felt peace and excitement at the same time if that’s possible. The peace of knowing that this life is not the end of our existence and of the excitement of reunions. While tears would certainly follow, there was a glow in the room that night that felt celestial and instructive, as though she wanted us to hear her say for the last time “…and this too shall pass”</p>
            <p>“Those we love never truly leave us. There are things that death cannot touch.” Jack Thorne (JK Rawlings)</p>
            <p>I feel like I can’t leave the topic of transition and beautiful places without one more experience of the passing of Donald Scotts, on his own terms. He had made the decision hours after his sweetheart passed that 91 years was well past the time that anyone should expect to travel this earth, especially when life support measures were keeping you tethered to this existence. The room where he spent his last hours here was private and peaceful. Most of the family had been in and out that day and expressed gratitude for the life changing influence he had on their lives. He was the step father of Ralph, John and Phillip but DNA differences never kept this man from giving everything he had to be the father those boys needed as they grew into fatherhood themselves.</p>
            <p>By 11PM that evening most had returned home after saying their goodbyes. Brynnley and I stayed in his room taking turns at his bedside comforting and being comforted. The experience was unique but no less spiritual as he prepared for transition. It appeared as though he was having a continuous dialogue with others but definitely not in a language that we understood. The nurse came in the room occasionally to report on his progress and because he wasn’t on life support we thought the process would be quick. By 2 AM nothing had changed and we decided to move the furniture around for makeshift sleeping arrangements. In the process of leaving his bedside to make our own beds and feeling a little less anxious, perhaps even a little irreverent about what we were experiencing, we noticed he wasn’t laboring anymore. It was so like Grandpa Don to quietly slip away on his own terms as he had lived his life. ‘Don’t fuss over me’ I felt I could hear him say. ‘Don’t remember my last breath but a lifetime of cherished moments together, and there were about a million!’</p>

        <h3><li>Describe your favorite places to spend the summer.</li></h3>
            <p>As a child from ages 9 to about 14 I remember time spent each summer for 7 to 10 days at my Uncle Joe and Aunt Lavere’s campground and lodge at Moon Lake in the Uintas. That's where I fell in love with fishing and the outdoors. We always had access to one of Uncle Joe's aluminum boats with a trolling engine that knew the exact speed to troll for those beautiful, yummy tasting lake trout. There was no electricity, only a  loud compressor that came on every night at dusk and went off at 11 PM, except on Tuesday which was wash and iron day. Once the power was off it was pitch black dark outside. You couldn't even see your hand in front of your face if you were sleeping in the lodge. I loved those summers and the connection I felt to Uncle Joe and Aunt Lavere!</p>
            <p>“There's no wifi in the mountains but I promise you’ll find a better connection!”</p>
            <p>I remember one Sunday afternoon going out with Aunt Lavere and Buddy, their son, on the horses and her singing ‘Cruising Down The River On A Sunday Afternoon’. I wanted the day to never end! Not that same year, but another time on the horses, the horse I was riding took off running to catch up with Buddy and the saddle slipped, my foot stayed in the stirrup, not a good move for this novice horse person. We went to the hospital in Duchesne for x-rays and the worst part was not the broken shoulder and arm but the cute male doc that had to cut my tee shirt off! At 12 years old…so humiliating!</p>
        
        <h3><li>What are some of your favorite memories from your twenties?</li></h3>
            <p>I loved that we got married, rented a small trailer, loaded our belongings and headed  to the great northwest to begin life together. Our first little house was in Gresham, Oregon, it was tiny and not well insulated. That first winter together in that little house was cozy! We had a record breaking ice/snow storm that year and the only heat was a small electric wall unit. What a surprise to wake up one morning with ice covering the windows, inside and out! Getting too close to the wall unit for heat, I smelled something burning :( surprise, it was my dress! I fell through the stairs on the rotten wooden porch and we nearly blinded the landlord when he tried to fix a plumbing issue in the kitchen where we had already tried Draino! Yikes! And that was our first month together!</p>
            <p>Motherhood (noun) the state of being a mother.  All my dreams of being a mom came true in the first 15 years of marriage, four of them were born in my 20’s. Each experience unique, miraculous and life changing, every birth a gift! I was so afraid of someone kidnapping our perfect babies, I would go in multiple times in the evenings just to make sure they were still there and breathing. It was a blessing living close to our parents in those years. Being there for holidays, summer camping and fishing trips and sunday dinners are some of the sweetest memories.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What was it like the first time you quit a job?</li></h3>
            <p>Every job I quit was always for something better and none of them very consequential so it was never a big deal. I suppose there were times when I wanted to quit my mom job but so as not to incriminate we’ll leave it at that!  🙂 </p>
        
        <h3><li>Are you still friends with any of your friends from college/early 20s?</li></h3>
            <p>I do have friends that I’m still in touch with from high school and a few from our college years. They've become more precious as years pass.</p>

    </ol>

    <h1>Reflective</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Are you an extrovert or an introvert?</li></h3>
            <p>I think there’s some of both in all of us but would describe myself as being mostly an extrovert.  While I don’t  feel comfortable in all social circumstances, perhaps because of low self esteem in childhood, I am definitely energized by social interaction. I just love people!</p>
            <p>However I also think we gain energy from being alone. I’ve discovered over the years that solitude is often where the creative process kicks in. It’s in those quiet moments that heaven often chooses to teach us in ways that require stillness.</p>

        <h3><li>What weaknesses do you struggle with the most?</li></h3>
            <p>Definitely procrastination! I never want to start something unless I have ample time to give it my best and then sometimes my best is not enough. Someone once said that someday is not a day of the week but my personal favorite is Mark Twain who said “Never put off till tomorrow what may be done day after tomorrow.” I’m working on it! </p>
            <p>I also love decorating and dressing on a budget but sometimes I go overboard at my favorite junk stops! And again, trying!</p>
        
        <h3><li>What is one of the greatest physical challenges you have ever had to go through? What gave you strength?</li></h3>
            <p>I once asked Davis if he remembered this incident and he didn’t but I actually thought I was going to die so I'll never forget. We were walking not far from the Mendel home along the creek in spring time. It's mostly flat but in a few areas there are  steep rocky inclines. Davis made it up one of these steep rocky hills with no problem of course and I was right behind him. At a certain  point however I had to let go of one hand to reach for the next rock to continue the climb but I knew if I let go I would certainly fall backwards and that would be it! I'd hit my head, there would be a lot of blood, and I would die. I didn’t want Davis to witness this horrible scene so I asked him to walk on and I would join him shortly. I prayed like I hadn’t prayed in a long time, ‘please help me God, I can’t see any way of getting out of this and I'm not ready to be with you yet!’ Not sure what happened next but I had the strength to lift myself up and off of the cliff.</p>
            <p>Certainly any woman that has given birth would say it's  one of the most physically challenging events in a woman’s life. I’ve witnessed it with my own daughters giving birth and personally as well. One experience I’ll never forget happened in the Netherlands while giving birth to Joseph. After a long difficult labor the doctor decided caesarian birth was the only way to get our 10+ pound baby safely here. I was not conscious for the surgical part but during that time the doctor severed the main artery in the uterus and when I woke up they were getting ready to give me a 7th unit of blood. I listened to what I could understand of the nurses talking about the American woman delivering her 7th child as if I were an alien from another planet:(. After hooking up that last unit of blood, they left the room. I could feel the rhythm of my heart pumping that blood up my arm and knew something was wrong. I remember looking at the clock and praying, "It’s just me and you God and I need your help.’ Just then the doctor that assisted in the C-section came in, introduced himself saying he wanted to stop by before leaving the hospital to see how I was doing. While expressing my concern about the blood he quickly removed the needle and flushed the line.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Do you believe in a higher power?</li></h3>
            <p>Do I believe in a higher power, in a father and mother in Heaven? Absolutely, unequivocally YES!</p>
        
        <h3><li>What is the farthest you have ever traveled and what is your most fond memory of that place?</li></h3>
            <p>"The real voyage of discovery consists not of seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.”Amen!  Marcel Proust</p>
            <p>I’ll never forget my first flight into Saudi Arabia. The waves of beautiful, wind blown sand was all I could see for miles from the airplane, a breathtaking experience.</p>
            <p>It was interesting to watch how busy the rest rooms became sometime after we flew into Arabian  airspace. I’ll never forget the Saudi men and a few women changing from their western clothing to the traditional Saudi thawb, white for men and black for women. Of course the women had to change in the back bathroom while the men used the front. It was like watching a two act play with a costume change.The tired traditions of the women seem outdated and harsh but what we held in common as women were far greater than our differences, the love of God and family being at the top.</p>
            <p>The second furthest and deserves mention is a trip in the mid eighties to the former USSR. From our first step on Russian soil in Moscow it was easy to feel the oppression. Tourists were treated like royalty. The hotels were beautiful and clean, the  food outstanding. Every tourist stop was planned to show the country in its best light.</p>
            <p>A few days and nights on our own painted completely different pictures however. The supermarket shelves were bare except for potatoes and onions in one store, or carrots and cabbage in another. No canned goods, dairy or fresh meats in any of the markets. After walking on our own we would go back to our hotel, eat caviar, fresh produce, meats and lovely desserts, dance to live music with Russians and other tourists, and at night would go to sleep in clean freshly ironed sheets.</p>
            <p>The churches were beautiful buildings with ornate art and stained glass windows but time and neglect had changed that.The soot covered walls and ceilings seemed an unhealthy place for elderly women and men who were trying hard to keep the doors open, while hoping for change. The famous Russian subways were beautiful, they looked more like museums. At this point my 'new eyes’ were teaching me a very important lesson in civic matters, Democracy is a beautiful thing! While communism calls for the government to take control of all the capital and industry in an effort to get rid of economic inequality, Democracy respects individuals’ rights to own property and means of production. Is the term ‘economic inequality’ a term we’re hearing more today by some big D politicians? Or is that just me?</p>
        
        <h3><li>Have you ever been a hero to someone? Has anyone been a hero for you?</li></h3>
            <p>Not sure. Perhaps my sister Cora in her younger years may have felt that way. We were almost 12 years apart but I loved including her in any way I could. (Fairly certain I changed more of her  diapers than anyone else:)  She was in Portland with us when Camille was born. I was her maid of honor for both weddings. She was an amazing artist, much more like our mom in that way. I miss her!</p>
            <p>I have so many heros that I wouldn't even know where to begin. I remember a school counselor in Jr. high school, Mr Dalton. He was always in the halls at school during passing time and was so friendly. One day he looked at my sorry face and said “Judy why don't you smile, it improves your face value.” Surprised that he even knew my name, I went home that day and in the bathroom mirror while holding a handheld mirror I looked at myself smiling, from the back, on the right and left side, smiling and frowning and he was right. I learned that day from one of my unexpected heros the face value of smiling 🙂</p>
            <p>There were people in my life that seemed to magnify all that I wished to be, that's probably normal, but one thing I've learned along the way is that life experiences can make or break us. It was in the late 1970’s, we were in Texas and Ralph had to be in Saudi for almost the entire month of December. Without asking me he called my mom and invited her to come stay with us for a few weeks. I was furious! Having her there would have been almost as bad as having 10 more kids, I thought. She came for part of the time and because the Inn was full we didn't have a place for her to sleep. The only option was sharing the king bed with me. Interesting how much easier it is to talk if you can't see your audience. And open up she did.</p>
            <p>She lost her Mom when she was 13, the youngest of 10 and she hated her new step mom. She left home, worked domestically for a prominent family in the area but didn't stay for long. Long story short, she had me at 23, hated my dad who probably hurt her in many ways and she punished him (and me) by keeping him as far away as she could. He finally gave up the fight and left the country. She made plenty of mistakes as we all do but I admire her for her example to me that in the process of course correction, she became accomplished in so many ways.  She was a great artist especially with textiles and ceramics. She couldn't read a pattern to save her soul, but she could look at a crochet piece and copy it exactly. There were things of her choosing that made life more complicated than it needed to be but I think it was Hank whose  love changed the paradigm for her. I’m grateful!</p>
        
        <h3><li>Have you ever had to make a tough moral decision? How did it turn out?</li></h3>
            <p>Plenty of times! Maybe more later.</p>
        
        <h3><li>How has the country changed during your lifetime?</li></h3>
            <p>I could write a book on this one question and never capture the significance of what is different today from 60 years ago. Just the reality of carrying a computer in our pocket or on our wrist was science fiction when I was in high school. Today probably 75% of all Americans own a smartphone, for better or worse, and that has changed everything. While social media has kept us in touch with our closest friend, family and the world at large it is also  a huge factor in addictive behavior, clinical depression and being self-absorbed.</p>
            <p>I remember when Nanny got the first TV in the neighborhood, she set up wooden crates in the living room and invited all the children on our street to watch episodes of The Lone Ranger Rides Again, in black and white ofcourse. In the 60’s and 70’s there were only three networks and they all signed off at midnight with an instrumental version of the National Anthem. This one is hard to believe but national and local news was always non biased, they reported the news not their opinion and we the people decided, not we the news anchors.</p>
            <p>As a seventy something year old grandmother and great  grandmother I mourn the loss of public civility.</p>
        
        <h3><li>If you had to do it all over again, would you pursue the same career path?</li></h3>
            <p>Absolutely! Being a parent has taught me more about life, has given me a broader perspective than almost any other thing I can think of. But being honest I'm sorry I didn't pursue my college education. I’m certain that it would have been a rewarding experience.  That being said, there are so many ways to learn, to grow, to serve, and give of oneself. It becomes a matter of discipline and desire. I always wanted to be a nurse, I guess I was, just never had the credentials or the paycheck!</p>
        
        <h3><li>If you were to do it over, what would you do differently?</li></h3>
            <p>That's such a hard question because everything about the 60’s were so different including the culture, economics, politics, family dynamics, family size. We were living somewhat mainstream and our values largely set by how we were raised and viewed the world. Education was important to me however, and given the opportunity to pursue it full time with one or two babies, may have been perfect by today's standards. But clearly having a large family was always something I dreamed of and we agreed on.</p>
            <p>Looking back, without regret however, I would have had greater confidence in my capabilities and worry less about what others thought. I would be more intentional about setting goals and doing scary things. I would take more time to experience the joy of learning, this would include a daily spiritual practice that involved study, prayer and meditation. I would keep a gratitude journal and make daily entries. Never too late however, mine is a can do world and it's never too late!</p>
        
        <h3><li>What were you doing when you were my age?</li></h3>
            <p>Awe Hattie, I can't remember that far back, ok I’ll try. I was pregnant with Camille and my favorite indulgence in the beginning of pregnancy was to sneak down to the drug store on the corner of Hall street. This was in Beaverton, Oregon, on a Saturday. They had the most delicious shake made with buttermilk and orange sherbert. It almost tasted healthy and was something I could actually keep down. Then I might walk to the library, get a book and devour it. Sunday was always for church and friends. Weekdays from 8-5 I would be in downtown Portland at the Blue Cross Blue Shield building key punch computer cards for billing. The computer took up an entire room and the key punching area was, well, I can't even describe the noise but it must have been soothing for Camille because after she was born she loved being in the same room with the clothes dryer on or by the stereo with soothing music. That was how she would go to sleep at night.</p>
            <p>Soon after that we bought our first house, again in Beaverton, but not close to the drug store. The house had three bedrooms, kitchen, living room and one bath with two doors, one from the master bedroom and one from the hall. It had beautiful hardwood floors, a double garage but no dishwasher and was on a large corner lot. We painted our way in for equity to keep the price down and mortgaged it for the gigantic price of $15,000. But wait, before you get too excited we only made between 8 and 10 thousand dollars yearly.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What do you wish you made more time in your life for?</li></h3>
            <p>Time is slippery and organizing is key, and I’m not very good at that. Planning today for tomorrow is the best way to get the most out of 24 hours, but how often do I make lists of short/long term goals? Not enough. Off the cuff here, are a few things that come to mind. In no particular order</p>
            <p>Travel; anywhere any time as long as it includes a return to Europe, then Australia, Israel/Egypt,  China, South Africa, Greenland, New York/ Washington DC in no particular order.</p>
            <p>Reading and writing - this would include my book “When Healing Begins” but reading for pleasure never gets the time it deserves.</p>
            <p>Classes in cooking, pottery, painting, writing</p>
            <p>More meaningful time with family and friends (and grandkids)</p>
            <p>Learning a foreign language</p>
            <p>Service; Temple and family research as well as community</p>
        
        <h3><li>What is one of your favorite memories of your mother?</li></h3>
            <p>For some reason I remember a time I was being rocked by my Mom. It was a large platform rocker, I think green. I just remember how comforting the motion was and being on her lap. It must have been a Sunday and I think she was living in a basement apartment at the time.</p>
            <p>I also remember a church dress she made  that I loved, I think I was 14 or 15. I put it on for the first time, went into the bathroom for something in the medicine cabinet and a bottle of acetone (fingernail polish remover) fell to the sink, broke and splashed on the dress. Everywhere it hit on the fabric it made big holes. I was devastated and afraid she would be mad. I was wrong, she didn't seem angry at all. Seeing how much I loved the dress she agreed to make another but other things got in the way like maybe a prom dress or two. I took a sewing class in school but I think my love of sewing came from seeing my mom create.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What advice would you give your 40-year-old self?</li></h3>
            <p>“The secret of health both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future or anticipate trouble but to live in the present moment wisely and presently”</p>
            <p>I would tell her to relax and savor every moment in a single blessed day. Interesting that in my twenties whenever I packed the Christmas decorations away I always thought in a melancholy way that someone else would be unpacking them the following year, it was so depressing! Don't do that! Soak in today as much as you can. Smile more, especially in the morning, it improves your face value. Don’t obsess over things you have no control over. If I had those days over I would worry less about tomorrow and concentrate more on living in the moment. Dream big, work hard, create memories.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What family tradition do you cherish the most?</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunday dinners after church</li>
            <li>Decorating the Christmas tree together and sleeping under it the first night</li>
            <li>Christmas music and stories including the nativity</li>
            <li>Christmas Eve food fest</li>
            <li>Hiding the pickle</li>
            <li>Family time on the fish bank</li>
            <li>Halloween, decorating and dressing up as a witch</li>
            <li>Easter egg hunt</li>

            <li>Large gatherings at Thanksgiving with traditional food and expressing thanks</li>
            <li>Large family reunions</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h3><li>What is one of the most romantic gestures you’ve ever made?</li></h3>
            <p>That would be an invitation to skinny dip with the man of my dreams in a private pool in Spain sometime after midnight. The End!!!</p>
        
        <h3><li>What is your idea of perfect happiness?</li></h3>
            <p>Perfect happiness is spending time with family and close friends. I remember a time when we were visiting the Thompsons when they lived in Victor, ID. Can't remember why they were there but it was only the girls on this particular shopping day. The weather was beautiful, we were in Driggs and I had just purchased a new pair of brand name shoes, on sale of course. We talked and laughed about silly girls stuff like StriVectin that had just hit the drug stores and would be the wrinkle cream that would end all wrinkles! I remember to this day the peace and contentment I felt in those moments of thinking if I died that day, life would have been worth it. I think happiness is the absence of negativity and the knowledge that God is at the center of our marriage and family, constantly guiding us to get through each day.</p>
                    
        <h3><li>As you spend Christmas in 2020, looking back, what have been the most memorable Christmases and Christmas traditions that you have created?</li></h3>
            <p>Awe Christmas thru the eyes of a child.</p>
            <p>One of the first Christmas memories I have was the first holiday after Mom and Hank were married and we were a family. I was almost 8 years old, we had a Christmas tree, I had a new friend, Reante, a German immigrant and life was changing! There was quite a party on Christmas Eve that year that I’ll never forget. It was just my uncle Leo and aunt Glenda that came that night and the only thing I remember them bringing was a Texas fifth. They didn’t have children and I was not included in the festivities.</p>
            <p>How could Santa come if it was noisy and there was a party going on? I finally did go to sleep and awoke later to a quiet, dark house. I tiptoed out towards the living room where the Christmas tree lights were on and indeed Santa had been there.  However something quite unexpected sent me running quickly back to my bed and under the covers.There right in front of the Christmas tree, lying on his back, sound asleep, in the buff, was Hank!  Yikes! An indelible memory! Christmas Eves were always spent in similar fashion either at our house or friends, but never again, with a giant Santa elf, sans clothing, under the Christmas tree.  (1952)</p>
            <p>The next memorable Christmas came many years later when I was 16 and dating the love of my life, that would be Ralph. He came over on Christmas Eve with a gift and made me promise not to open it until Christmas. I agreed (with my fingers crossed!). After he left I was alone and couldn’t help myself. I went into the bathroom, locked the door in case the parents came home early (opening gifts before Christmas at our house was akin to a federal offense) so I carefully unwrapped it so as not to tear the paper. It was a beautiful sweater and plaid pants (yes plaid, very in) to match. I tried it on, it fit perfectly, his mother was quite the diva and shopper in those days. I wrapped it up, put it under the tree and nobody knew until this day.</p>
            <p>I’ll never forget the first Christmas tree after we were married. I had planned in September that it would be decorated with pink lights and all the pink bows from our wedding gifts. I wish we had a picture of it because you would agree, it was very modern avant-garde. Pink was it in 1964.</p>
            <p>Finally the Christmas that makes the list of most memorable was our first Christmas in the Netherlands. Not knowing enough about the customs and culture of Christmas in a foreign country (I mean why wouldn’t it be like ours?), Christmas gift giving almost didn’t happen that year. In the Netherlands Christmas presents from Sinterklaas come on his birthday which is  December 5th and by the 6th of December all toys, books, and Christmas anything to do with children are off the shelves, which would be ok if our household shipment made it there before Christmas. We carried what we could in our luggage but it was touch and go. However my memory is of the fun and festive way we celebrated when all we had was each other. We bought a pathetic Dutch Christmas tree, it looked like a Charlie Brown tree, with a few Dutch ornaments. We had turkey for Christmas dinner that came with feet, a head and pin feathers. Who knew turkeys looked like that? We played games and giggled night after night. Then on Christmas Day all of the Netherlands go to church, Christmas is always a spiritual holiday. Yes we had lonely homesick moments, it was the hardest on the older children, but over all we loved, supported and held tight to each other and made memories that would last a lifetime. December 1979</p>
                
        <h3><li>What is your best relationship advice?</li></h3>
            <p>Be honest, maybe the most important. I think it's the key to having a happy and lasting relationship. It's better to face the truth than let it sabotage your relationship.</p>
            <p>Conflict can be helpful if at the end you concentrate on rebuilding. Avoid the blame game and be as generous as possible. Be open to change your mind and at the end of the conflict,  focus on reconnecting. Be generous and kind</p>
                
        <h3><li>What did you learn from your parents?</li></h3>
            <p>Life and relationships can be complicated. As much as we think we understand a person or their circumstances, it’s only a guess from a particular point of view. It's not that they are taught by presept, life’s lessons, but by their examples and choices that were part of everyday living.</p>
