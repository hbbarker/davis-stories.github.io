    <h2>Stories To Remember</h2>
    <p>In December of 2020, I sent Ralph and Judy Davis an email explaining the purpose of this project. I wanted this to be a fun and enjoyable outlet for them to recollect on their time together and individually. Originally, this was going to be put together into a scrapbook format and distributed to family members. However, as time progressed, I found that I would have less of it than I thought to create the book I believed Ralph and Judy deserve. So here I have created a “work in progress.” This website is in no means complete or perfect. But maybe that is perfect. Because now as time progresses, as relentless as it is, this website can adapt to new and intriguing stories from Ralph and Judy but also from us, as family members of this beautiful, crazy, and loving family.</p>
    <p>This website serves many purposes for the Davis Family Tree. First and foremost being a place to read about the experiences of our parents and grandparents. In the tabs at the top of this page, you can navigate between “Ralph” and “Judy” and read their thoughtful responses to a wide variety of questions I have sent them over the years. The second purpose, being that with a website, there are many other stories that can be told beside the prescribed questions. Under the “Autobiographical Additives” tab, you will find stories and pictures that I have had the pleasure of collecting and displaying. There are a great deal of fascinating memories embedded in this website, I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I have!</p>
