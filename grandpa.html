    <h1>Marriage</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>How and/or why did you decide to get married?</li></h3>
        <p>Why did we decide to get married? We were married in September of 1964. While the ‘60s did produce quite a number of cultural changes, living together outside of marriage was still not generally practiced. In addition, both Judy and I came from very conservative backgrounds and families. The expectation of family and friends and our own expectations were that we would be married. Really the only remaining question was when and where. Also, our religious beliefs dictated that our marriage be performed in one of the Temples of the Church. Living together outside of marriage was never a consideration for us.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What are some choices you made about how to raise your children?</li></h3>
        <p>Perhaps our first choice was teaching our children how important it is to be skillful in making decisions. Decision making is crucial because the decisions our children make, and the consequences of each decision will dictate the path that their lives will take.</p>
        <p>We made the choice of raising our children in the practice of religion that we ourselves had adopted from our ancestors. While this choice was easier for our children to accept when they were young, some of them chose other paths to follow in their adulthood.</p>
        <p>As our children aged, we chose to spend time with each child. We chose to be involved in our child’s school, go to school events, and meet with teachers. We encouraged our children to participate on a sports team or a community group. We chose to help them develop a sense of responsibility by giving each of them some household tasks to complete. We chose to help them learn how to set goals and follow through with tasks. We chose to do things together as a family.</p>
        <p>As teenagers we chose to show interest in their schools and extracurricular interests and activities and encourage them to become involved in sports, music, and art.</p>
        <p>We chose to give them a multicultural experience by choosing to live in Europe for a number of years where they were exposed to different languages, cultures, and values.</p>
        <p>We chose to let them spend quality time with their grandparents in an effort to foster a love and appreciation for their contribution to their lives.</p>
        <p>We encouraged them to always choose good friends and to nurture those relationships and avoid dangerous or unhealthy activities.</p>
    </ol>
    
    <h1>Childhood</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Were your parents happy?</li></h3>
        <p>The answer to this needs to be divided into two different time frames. The first time frame would be when my biological mother and father were together before their divorce. The second time frame would be with the many years that my step-father and mother were together after their marriage.</p>
        <h5>First time frame:</h5>
        <p>I can remember some very happy times associated with my biological parents. So, I would say that, yes, they were happy for a while. I remember some happy times together camping and fishing at Ferron Reservoir. I remember happy times at our small house in Orangeville, Utah where we lived close to my grandmother Davis. However, parents can be fairly good at disguising unhappy times and a marriage that came unraveled by the time that I was eleven years old.</p>
        <h5>Second time frame:</h5>
        <p>My mother was a single mom from her divorce from my father in April 1956 to her marriage to Donald M Scott in August of 1957. Were they happy? I would graduate from high school in May 1961 and be gone from the house and any close association with my mom and stepfather. But I do know that whenever we were together with family functions, outings, fishing trips, reunions, and so forth, they were very happy. Were there tough times during their many years together? Of course. It is my personal experience that every marriage will face tough, challenging times and there will be periods of time when each partner is not very happy. That said, it would be my guess that happiness was a part of their marriage for over 90 percent of the time.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What were your favorite subjects in high school?</li></h3>
        <p>My high school was Granger High School in Utah from which I graduated in 1961. I would call myself an all-right student but not one that received a straight A average. While I was mostly interested in sports such as baseball, basketball, and a little bit in football these probably don’t count as subjects in high school. So here are what I now believe were my favorite subjects while in high school:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Psychology</li>
                <li>Typing or keyboarding</li>
                <li>Mathematics, but not geometry</li>
                <li>History, especially world history</li>
            </ul>  
        <p>Some classes/subjects that I struggled with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>English (literature, writing)</li>
                <li>Science (biology, chemistry)</li>
                <li>Geometry</li>
            </ul>      
      
        <h3><li>What did you hide from your parents as a child?</li></h3>
        <p>As I attempt to respond to this question, most of my memories of trying to hide things from my parents occurred when my mother was divorced from my dad and she had not yet married my step dad, Don Scott.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I had taken up playing the trombone in junior high school and my mom was paying for private trombone lessons. I was not very diligent in maintaining my practice schedule and so I would try hiding my practice sheets from her. However, it was obvious that when it came time for my lessons, that I was not practicing enough.</li>
                <li>I had a friend named Jim Thomas. Jim was pretty rebellious and liked to take his father’s pickup for nighttime rides without his father’s knowledge. Of course, I would go with him whenever I could find a good reason to leave the house. Obviously, I was trying to hide these little illegal rides from my mother.</li>
                <li>In addition to number 2 above, I tried to hide other relationships with friends that my mother did not approve of entirely.</li>
                <li>I tried to hide my fear for my mother’s health when she was experiencing so much pain with her gallbladder attacks. </li>
                <li>My mother was a smoker for a period of time in her life. While she was going through this stage, I would try to hide my experimenting with smoking cigarettes from her. It usually didn’t work.</li>
            </ol>  
       
       <h3><li>Which sports teams were you a fan of as a child?</li></h3>
        <p>While I’m not exactly sure what ages constitute being a child, I will give you a little background on my early childhood before answering this question. During most of my early childhood, say from 5 years old to 8 or 9 years old, I either lived with my grandparents Snow or lived with my parents in the tiny towns of Ferron and/or Orangeville, Utah. Most of these years were lived without television or telephones. The only phone in Ferron was at Aaron’s Café in town. To my knowledge my grandparents never owned a television set.</p>
        <p>So, as a young child, I didn’t know anything about sports teams. Later on, however, when we moved to Kearns, Utah and had access to television and telephones, I became an ardent fan of the New York Yankees baseball team. Players like Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Don Larsen, and Roger Maris were my idols and we invented games and gave the make-believe players the names of the New York Yankee players. If the Yankees were in the world series, I would fake being sick so I could stay home from school to watch that day’s game.</p>
        <p>When I became aware of professional football, I followed the Dallas Cowboys. Early on they were called “America’s Team” and I was a solid fan of the team. However, my enthusiasm for football never came close to the love that I had for baseball and particularly the New York Yankees.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What games did you play when you were young?</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kick the can</li>
            <li>Flashlight</li>
            <li>Wooden boat racing down the irrigation ditches</li>
            <li>Cowboys and Indians (before it was not PC)</li>
            <li>Tug-a-war (rope pull)</li>
            <li>Bobbing for apples</li>
            <li>Red Rover, Red Rover</li>
            <li>Fish</li>
            <li>Hopscotch – the traditional game</li>
            <li>Jump the rope – the traditional game</li>
            <li>Puzzles</li>
            <li>Mother may I?</li>
            <li>Hide the thimble</li>
            <li>King of the mountain</li>
            <li>Hide and seek</li>
            <li>Spin the bottle</li>
            <li>Marbles either with a taw trying to shoot other marbles out of a circle or lagging your taw into a set of circular holes in the ground several feet away from the starting point.</li>
            <li>First electronic game was a football type game where one player selected an offensive play, and the other player selected a defensive play. The selected plays were placed in the electronic box and then displayed on a panel. Direction arrows indicated the success or failure of that selection of plays.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3><li>When did you get your first car?</li></h3>
        <p>I don’t remember the exact date but I’m pretty sure it was soon after I was able to get my driver’s license so most likely around 16 years old.  Don was married to my mom by that time, and he took me to a used car dealer on State Street in Murray and we bought a 1949 Chevrolet 2-door sedan. It had a 3-speed standard transmission (clutch) with the shifting mechanism mounted on the steering column. I had driven a tractor on the farm with a clutch but never a car or truck. After the sale was completed, Don handed me the keys to the car then got in the car that we had arrived in and drove away. It was a very interesting next few minutes as I tried to figure out where the gears were, how to work the clutch and get the car moving forward without stalling. Somehow it all worked, and I had many memories later that would involve that first car!</p>
        
        <h3><li>How would your parents have described you?</li></h3>
        <p> I wish that my parents were still around to ask them this same question. But they are not, so I will do my best to understand how they might have seen me. First of all, since I was the oldest child in the family, they would most likely have described me as reliable, obedient, and dependable when it came to watching over my younger brothers. They might have also described me as honest, prompt, mostly intelligent, and sometimes stubborn (music lessons). As a father to a growing family, they may have described me as being ill-advised to have so many children. However, they greatly enjoyed their association with all their grandchildren. As they aged, they most likely would have described me as loving, kind, and thoughtful.</p>
       
        <h3><li>What sports did you like most as a child? Why?</li></h3>
        <p>As you most likely know by now, I lived in a farming community when I was a child. As such, there were no organized sports like baseball, basketball, soccer, or football. So I would have to say that horseback riding was my favorite “sport” as a child. Not only was it one of the only methods for me and my cousins to get from place to place but it was our means of fun and sometimes also for work. Not that you could call it a sport but another of our favorite things to do was to build caves in the hillsides alongside the Ferron creek. We spent many hours in this pursuit.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What were you like in high school?</li></h3>
        <p>What was I like in high school? I was 17 when I graduated from high school and only turned 18 on my birthday in July following graduation. So what was I like at ages 15, 16, and 17? I will work backwards – my senior year was the best. Judy and I were a pretty steady thing and most that knew us in school were aware of that. I was an okay student my senior year and studies were important to me. My extra time in senior year was devoted to sports and I was involved with the baseball, basketball, and football teams. I particularly enjoyed baseball. I had a car (mentioned in an earlier question) so that gave me a bit more credibility as a senior.</p>
        <p>Sophomore and junior years were mostly years of expectation. Expecting what it would be like to be a senior and graduate from high school. Only made the baseball team as a sophomore. Was not interested in football and didn’t make the basketball team. Concentrated on my studies and made good marks during both years. Junior year I did make both the basketball and baseball teams.</p>
        <p>I very much enjoyed my high school experience and remember that time as a critical development time for what would lie ahead in my future.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What store or restaurant did you love to go to as a child?</li></h3>
        <p>When I was a kid growing up in Ferron, Utah there were really only two options for a store or restaurant. The first option was to take a nickel and ride our bikes to Darrell’s drug store to either buy a small bag full of penny candy or perhaps a small glass of cherry coke at the counter of his store. He served also as the pharmacist and did not serve any food, but we could get an ice cream cone. It was the highlight of our day to sit on the stools and enjoy a cold drink.</p>
        <p>The second option was Aaron’s Café. Here we could get a hot meal and it was either breakfast before a day’s work with my grandfather or perhaps lunch but never dinner. Incidentally, the only phone in town for several years was in his café and a runner would have to be sent out to retrieve the person who was receiving the call. The food was okay, but I liked being there because I had a crush on his pretty daughter who was also my age.</p>
        <p> I was in Ferron several months ago for a funeral of my cousin’s wife and noticed that the building that included Darrell’s drug store has been remodeled and the drug store is gone. Most likely has been gone for a long time. Aaron’s Café and the small motel that it included is still there but empty and in disrepair. Time has not been kind to them. I do not know what happened to his daughter that at one time was the focus of my attention. However, these are fond memories that I have enjoyed revisiting!</p>
       
        <h3><li>What television programs did you watch as a child?</li></h3>
            <ul>

                <li>The Rifleman</li>

                <li>The Millionaire</li>
            </ul> 
    
        <h3><li>Were you ever teased about anything as a child?</li></h3>
        <p>I don’t remember ever being teased about anything as a child.</p>

        <h3><li>What was your favorite memory of school? (at any age)</li></h3>
        <p>I have two favorite memories from high school that I would share to answer this particular question. Both of them involved participating in sports during high school. The first was in a basketball game against a particularly bitter rival high school. The game was being played at their school and was tied at the end of regulation and tied again at the end of the first overtime period. The game then went into what is called “sudden death” meaning the first team to score a basket wins the game. The game ended when a teammate passed the ball to me as I stood near the basket with no one around me and I made the short shot. The game was over!</p>
        <p>The second memory was while I was playing varsity baseball. Again we were playing at a rival school’s field. The game was tied going into the last inning and my team was at bat. After several  of my teammates had batted and a couple were on base and a couple had made outs, I was “on deck” to bat and the coach of the other team decided to intentionally walk the batter before me which loaded the bases. They only needed one additional out to get out of the inning and must have thought that I would be a sure out that would end the inning for us. However, on the first pitch to me I was able to handle a fast ball and proceeded to hit it out of the park for what would be the winning runs in the game. It was a thrill!</p>

    <h1>Raising Children</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>What are your favorite memories of each of your children growing up (or of them collectively)?</li></h3>
<!--the spacing needs to be fixed for this one-->
    
        <DL>
        <DT>Camille</DT>
        <DD>My personal favorite memories of Camille take place while we lived in The Netherlands and Camille participated in basketball, softball, and track. She was good in all three of these programs but I believe that she excelled in basketball, then track, and then softball. It was our good fortune to be able to follow her and her teams throughout Europe and enjoy seeing some of Europe’s most beautiful cities at the same time. Some of those cities included Vienna, Paris, London, Frankfurt, and Brussels.</DD>
        
        <DT>Kurt</DT>
        <DD>Kurt loved baseball and I will always treasure watching him progress from Little League to a starter on the high school baseball team when we moved to Auburn.</DD>
        <DD>Kurt loved dogs and pretty much had them as part of his life for many years. I will never forget how much some of them slobbered and shed.</DD>
        <DD>Kurt loved to fish and spent quite a number of fishing trips with his grandparents as well as his immediate family.</DD>
        <DD>Kurt loved to help and I remember particularly him taking the lead in putting new shingles on our home in Auburn.</DD>
        <DD>Kurt loved his two children and would go anywhere at any time to watch them in sports or whatever else they were doing. I remember specifically Kurt faithfully following all of Brett’s high school tennis matches.</DD>
        
        <DT>Ryan</DT>
        <DD>Ryan was always a great friend. Growing up in Auburn and throughout his high school years he was close friends with Derrick Stratton and Dan Roach. Those three were almost as close as brothers.</DD>
        <DD>Ryan was a good athlete but never played on any high school team. He and Derrick were avid beach ball or sand volleyball players and took every occasion possible to enter tournaments.</DD>
        <DD>Ryan once wanted to learn how to play the saxophone. I remember fondly him grabbing his sax and always playing some kind of rapid melody. He always played the same one!</DD>
        <DD>Ryan once was helping me with a paper route when we lived in Auburn. I remember one early morning, we were in separate cars,  when we went to pick up the papers he ran into the back of my car because he was still mostly asleep. He didn’t like the paper route.</DD>
        <DD>Ryan was a good missionary for the church. I treasure the picture that we have of him sitting on the sidewalk with a street person talking. He had great compassion for those who had less in this life.</DD>
       
        <DT>Brynnley</DT>
        <DD>Brynnley was our first child born while we were living in Houston. I remember her being very anxious to get to earth and our family because she could not wait for the doctor to get to the delivery room.</DD>
        <DD>I remember with some horror the time that Brynnley was standing by a window in our home in Houston and not realizing until it was too late that there were “fire ants” crawling up her legs and beginning to sting her. It was awful as the ants carried a significant sting.</DD>
        <DD>Brynnley took to playing the violin very early and was very good. She took private lessons while we lived in the Netherlands and also played in a youth orchestra while we were there. She and Judy would travel to Rotterdam on the train every week to either practice or be part of the orchestra.</DD>
        <DD>Another time that I will always remember took place with Brynnley while we were living in the Netherlands. She was alone in the bathtub and became very quiet. When Judy went to check on her she was sound asleep in the tub laying on her back with her long red hair splayed out floating on the water. It was a little unnerving to see her like that.</DD>
        <DD>I remember Brynnley learning how to ski as a young girl when we made some of our winter trips to various ski resorts in Austria. She was a quick learner.</DD>
      
        <DT>Brooke</DT>
        <DD>I remember that while we were living in the Netherlands at our house on Frankenslag street, we had quite a mouse problem in the house, and one morning I had killed a mouse with my shoe and it was still laying in the hall and Brooke saw it and began to cry. I told her that the mouse was just asleep and that it would be alright.</DD>
        <DD>Another memory from our time in the Netherlands with Brooke was her adopting a wild rabbit as a pet. She eventually had to release it back into the wild as we were preparing to move back to the US from the Netherlands. She was heartbroken.</DD>
        <DD>Still another memory from our time in the Netherlands with Brooke was her ability as a very young child to pick up the language of the Dutch. She attended klueter (preschool) school with the local Dutch children in the area and developed the ability to speak with her Dutch friends in their language and turn immediately to an American friend and speak English. It was pretty amazing.</DD>
        <DD>Brooke has always had a mechanical talent, meaning she was pretty good at keeping her cars running when something went wrong. There were many times when she and I would be working on one of her cars and she was right there getting her hands greasy. She and I totally changed out an engine in a VW Rabbit at Grandpa Hank’s house at one point. We had to buy a Sawsall in order to cut the old engine out of the car.</DD>
        <DD>Brooke has great compassion for those less advantaged. I remember her working soon after finishing university at a youth detention center in Tacoma, WA. It was a tough, mentally and physically challenging job but she loved the kids there and gave her whole heart in trying to make their lives better. She and I donated a new picnic table to the center that we made and assembled at the center.</DD>
        <DD>Of course, how can I forget her time on the climb of Mt. Rainier in 1999. It was not easy being a girl on that trip with almost all other climbers being boys and men. She made the most of every moment on the mountain and proved herself every bit as fit in endurance and skill as anyone on the mountain during those three days. I was very proud of her then and now.</DD>
        
        <DT>Jaime</DT>
        <DD>I remember as a child Jaime was always ready to step forward to lead the charge into something new or that proved a little scary for her older brothers and sisters. “I will do it, I’ll go first” was her mantra as a young child and that character trait has pretty much stayed with her throughout her life.</DD>
        <DD>Jaime has always been good at doing imitations and speaking with different accents. It is a gift that she has often shared with her family and one that has brought many laughs and good times.</DD>
        <DD>I remember on one of our European family vacations to Greece with fondness. We were staying in a small town right on the seashore. Jaime, Brooke, and Brynnley had made friends with some other children who were also staying in the area. They did not know each other’s language but were able to have fun and play together and sing a little song, clap their hands, and jump into the sea. It was a very fun thing to watch.</DD>
        <DD>I remember when Jaime and Travis were first married they lived in a tiny house in Victor, ID that when the wind would blow, the floor in the little house would actually move up and down. It was weird.</DD>
        <DD>I remember getting phone calls from Jaime while she was still in school at Ricks College in Rexburg, ID. She was in a very demanding Interior Design program at Ricks and would be in tears when she called, explaining to us that she could not do the work because it was too difficult and the demands of the program were too extreme. Now, years later, she has her own interior design business and is in high demand because of her talents and skills.</DD>
        <DD>Jaime is a great thrift store shopper or as she and her mother like to call this activity, a great hunter. Going to the thrift stores is to go “hunting”. Whenever Judy and I are visiting with Jaime and her family, the two of them will make several “hunting” trips into the thrift stores in the surrounding area.</DD>

        <DT>Joseph</DT>
        <DD>I remember a couple of choice memories from Joseph’s early years in the Netherlands. First of him on roller skates at about 3 years old going up and down the sidewalk along Frankenslag street at a breakneck speed. He was not afraid of anything.</DD>
        <DD>Second of him on our family vacation to a lovely village in Spain where we had rented a very nice villa. The villa had a large outdoor pool, a barbecue pit, and some other nice amenities. Well as soon as the family got out of the van, Joseph saw the pool and ran right over to it and jumped in, clothes and all. Kurt had to hurry over to the pool and pull him out. Again, Joseph had no fear.</DD>
        <DD>I remember when Joseph was 11 years old he wanted to play football on the junior high team in Auburn. At his first practice with the team another player landed on his arm in an awkward way and broke a bone in his wrist. Just a few days later after getting a cast on his wrist up to his elbow, he decided that he wanted to participate in climbing Mt. St. Helens with a group  that I was taking to the summit. He climbed with the pain and awkwardness of the cast and made it to the summit with all the older boys.</DD>
        <DD>I remember asking Joseph to umpire little league games with me in Auburn. This wasn’t the most fun thing to do for anyone but particularly not for a 12 or 13 year old boy. Some of the coaches were pretty hard on the umpires but Joseph took the verbal harangue without becoming angry or upset</DD>
        <DD>Joseph’s leadership in our climb of Mt. Rainier in 1999 is documented “here”.</DD> <!-- make a link here-->
        <DD>There are quite a number of incidents (injuries) associated with Joseph’s skiing outings. I will only mention the one that I, as his father, thought was the most severe. This particular injury occurred while he was skiing at Whistler Resort in British Columbia with his friend Stewart Rasmussen. The story goes that Joseph made a jump but lost control on the landing. The tip of one of his skis came forward and up toward his face and hit his ski goggles right at his eye. The goggles saved his eyesight in the injured eye but the eye socket itself was fractured. It was a severe injury and Joseph was taken off the slopes by the ski patrol in their basket. Judy drove to Whistler from Seattle to pick Joseph up and bring him home. His recovery took time but eventually healed completely.</DD>
        <DD>Joseph’s eye injury occurred just a few weeks before his 18 birthday and he still needed to finish his Eagle Scout project. As part of the treatment of his eye injury, he had to have a small bladder inserted into his sinus cavity while his eye socket healed and a tube hanging out of his nose so that the bladder could be inflated. He was a sorry sight but in this condition he made contacts with several merchants in the area to solicit materials so that he could finish his scout project. He was determined.</DD>

        <h3><li>How did you figure out how to be a parent?</li></h3>
        <p>Because there is no Parent’s Handbook guiding new parents, figuring out how to be a parent comes down basically to two things: 1) You copy what you saw your parents and grandparents do; and 2) Your own experiences.</p>
        <p>The list below outlines some the parental practices either learned from my parents/grandparents or that Judy and I have tried to adopt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Teach my children to be honest, to be patient, to be civil, to have integrity, to have a strong work ethic, to be compassionate, and to embrace challenges.</li>
            <li>Teach my children to use their freedom of choice with great care and thoughtfulness. Understanding that there will always be a consequence associated with their choices.</li>
            <li>Teach my children to be punctual and to keep their word when it has been given. To always follow through with promises or commitments that have been made. To always do what they say they are going to do!</li>
            <li>Teach my children to serve others even when it may not be easy or convenient.</li>
            <li>Teach my children to forgive when forgiveness is necessary.</li>
            <li>Teach my children the importance of good hygiene and a balanced diet.</li>
            <li>Teach my sons the importance of respect towards their mother and other women and girls that will come into their lives.</li>
            <li>Teach my children the importance of family bonds including learning about those family members that have died.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><li>How did you decide when to have children? </li></h3>
        <p>Judy and I never really talked about any kind of a plan concerning when to or how many children to have in our family.  We both knew that we wanted to have a large family but no number was ever placed on “large”. The first “when” was our delight in discovering that we were pregnant with our first child who we would name Camille.</p>

    </ol>

    <h1>Adulthood</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>If you could have as much money as you wanted, what would you do with it?</li></h3>
            <p>I cannot speak from experience concerning this question but from the public knowledge of some uber-wealthy people in the news, I can make an educated guess on how best to use an unlimited supply of money.</p>
            <p>I would give to family members only enough to cover their very basic needs such as to cover the mortgage on a moderate home and to help educate their children through a moderately costly college, university, or trade school.</p>
            <p>I would invest as wisely as possible to cover my retirement years with a side fund to cover some traveling to parts of the world that we have not yet enjoyed.</p>
            <p>I would cover any medical costs for all my families that were incurred but not covered by their health insurance. If there were a possibility that long term care of family members would be needed, I would set up a fund to cover these possibilities.</p>
            <p>I would donate money to help cover research into medical conditions that have as yet not been solved such as MS, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and others.</p>
            <p>I would donate money to charities that work with third world countries to bring basic things to their people like clean water, housing, and medical treatments and supplies.</p>
            <p>I would consider donating money to my local communities to help upgrade schools, parks, and other publicly used facilities.</p>
            <p>I would consider donating to other beneficial causes that might be brought to me by individuals or organizations.</p>
            <p>I would consider donating to political causes that are consistent with my conservative views.</p>

        <h3><li>Have you ever sued someone, or been sued by someone?</li></h3>
            <p>The short answer is yes, one time. We moved into our home in Salem in September of 2014. In June of 2016 we experienced the main sewer line backing up through the floor drain in the basement utility room. On June 8, 2016 I hired a plumber to come resolve the problem. His inspection found that the main sewer line had been broken and had separated just a few feet in from the sidewalk and below the surface by about 12 feet. The main sewer line would have to be uncovered and repaired at the break.</p>
            <p>I then contacted the City of Salem and they sent a crew to basically do the same procedure as had been done by the plumber. They concurred that the line would need to be uncovered and repaired. I asked the man from the city to call our General Contractor and get him involved in the repair of the line but the builder insisted that he had no warranty liability for the problem because it had occurred more than a year after we took possession of the home.</p>
            <p>I started doing some research after the General Contractor made those remarks and found that the Utah Supreme Court in October 2010 had recognized an Implied Warranty for New Home Buyers. The statement in the Court’s decision that I was hoping would apply to our situation was this “…each new home buyer is entitled to a home free of latent defects that go to the home’s workmanship and habitability.”</p>
            <p>On November 10, 2016 I filed papers in District Court of Utah County against our General Contractor with the intention of taking him to Small Claims Court in an attempt to get him to pay for the repairs of the sewer line. There is an arbitration procedure prior to meeting with the judge that each participant in the lawsuit must attend. It was during arbitration that the General Contractor was convinced that he had financial responsibility and he wrote a check in June 2017 to cover the repairs.</p>

        <h3><li>Are you superstitious?</li></h3>
            <p>I don’t believe that I have ever been seriously superstitious. Some of the usual superstitions like Friday the 13th, black cats crossing your path, beginner’s luck, or breaking a mirror have never been an issue for me. However, I try not to walk under a ladder and sometimes I find myself “knocking on wood” to keep something from happening. As a kid my brothers and I would always want to get the wishbone from the chicken or turkey so we could make a wish. So I guess I do have some superstitions!</p>
            
        <h3><li>Have you ever sleep-walked or sleep-talked, or done anything unconsciously? </li></h3>
            <p>To my knowledge, I have never walked in my sleep. Have I talked in my sleep? Perhaps Judy would have to answer that question. I did fall asleep one time when much younger and driving when I was very fatigued. Luckily, I awoke before driving off the road or hitting another vehicle.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What are your favorite plays?</li></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hamlet by Shakespeare</li>
                <li>Twelfth Night also by Shakespeare</li>
                <li>A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens</li>
                <li>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</li>
                <li>Les Miserables</li>
                <li>Fiddler on the Roof</li>
            </ul>  

        <h3><li>What qualities do you most value in your better half?</li></h3>
            <p>These would be some of the qualities that I most value in Judy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patience – a great deal of patience has been required on her part to stay with me for all these years</li>
                <li>Kindness – kindness is love in action and that is certainly what I see in Judy every day</li>
                <li>Humility – being teachable and reaching out to serve others</li>
                <li>Forgiveness – being able to choose compassion over resentment</li>
                <li>Gratitude – being grateful for the good and accepting of the not so good</li>
                <li>Wisdom – knowing the right thing to do or to say</li>
                <li>Trust – being able to find meaning and purpose in all that she experiences</li>
            </ul>  
            <p>There are others, of course, but these would be at the top of my list.</p>
            
        <h3><li>What is one of the most beautiful places you've ever been?</li></h3>
            <p>Having the great fortune to have lived in Europe for almost five years, we had the opportunity as a family to visit some intensely beautiful places. I am going to mention only a few of them that I can remember:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Cathedral of Vasily the Blessed, commonly known as Saint Basil's Cathedral, is an Orthodox church in Red Square of Moscow, and is one of the most popular cultural symbols of Russia. When we visited here the cathedral had recently been refurbished and the various colors were striking and very beautiful.</li>
                <li>The Matterhorn is a mountain of the Alps, straddling the main watershed and border between Switzerland and Italy. It is a large, near-symmetric pyramidal peak in the extended Monte Rosa area of the Pennine Alps, whose summit is 4,478 meters high, making it one of the highest summits in the Alps and Europe. We stayed at a small hotel close to the foot of the mountain and it was complete with two St. Bernard rescue dogs. The dogs and the setting were breathtaking.</li>
                <li>Keukenhof, also known as the Garden of Europe, is one of the world's largest flower gardens, situated in the town of Lisse, in the Netherlands. The Keukenhof Park covers an area of 32 hectares and approximately 7 million flower bulbs are planted in the gardens annually. When we were visiting there, our young daughter, Brooke, innocently took hold of a stem of a beautiful tulip and pulled the whole flower, bulb and all, out of the ground!</li>
                <li>Madurodam is a miniature park and tourist attraction in the Scheveningen district of The Hague in the Netherlands. It is home to a range of 1:25 scale model replicas of famous Dutch landmarks, historical cities and large developments.</li>
                <li>Versailles - It's 1667 and 28-year-old King Louis XIV has finally taken over sole command of France. When he commissions Versailles, Europe's most beautiful palace, the nobles seek entry into the lavish residence, which they do not realize is meant to imprison and control them. Among the ruler's prime targets is his younger brother, Monsieur. There's also romance in King Louis' life, as his queen, Marie Theresa, tries to tame his wandering eyes and win his heart back from his mistress, the English king's sister. Love, power, betrayal and war are all part of daily life in Versailles.</li>
                <li>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. The climb to the observation platform at the top takes a bit of energy but the view of surrounding Paris is incredible.</li>
                <li>The Parthenon is a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, dedicated to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron. Construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the peak of its power.</li>
                <li>Colosseum in Rome</li>
                <li>Pompeii - the lost city of Pompeii, was buried by millions of tons of volcanic ash when Mt Vesuvius erupted in 79AD. It is now the longest continually excavated archaeological site in the world and excavations gradually reveal a complex and modern city, frozen in time.</li>
                <li>Sorrento, Amalfi Coast, Italy</li>
                <li>Lech is simply one of the best and one of the most exclusive resorts in Austria. The internationally famous village is dominated by a lovely 14th century church and river, high up in the Arlberg valley next to the tiny hamlet of Zürs, all surrounded by stunning peaks. Our family skied at this resort a couple of times while we lived in the Netherlands. During one of those visits our daughter, Camille, met and skied with the Prince of the royal family of the Netherlands.</li>
            </ol> 
        
        <h3><li>Describe your favorite places to spend the summer.</li></h3>
            <p>This question will be somewhat easier to answer than the previous question. The answer to the question is that my favorite place to spend the summer would be any place where all members of our family could be together. But to be slightly more specific, I will list a few of my favorites that have become favorites throughout my lifetime.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ferron Reservoir – As a youngster and as a young adult, this was by far my favorite place to spend the summer. Many outings of fishing and hunting have been enjoyed while camping here. One of my earliest memories of fishing with my birth dad took place here. We had rented an old wooden boat to use for fishing but we didn’t fish from the boat. We fished from the bank and dad would row the boat to take our lines out and drop them into the water because we did not have casting reels in those days.</li>
                <li>Strawberry Reservoir – This was another favorite family vacation choice and many fishing and camping outings were enjoyed here.</li>
                <li>Lodgepole Campground – Located at the top of Daniel’s summit about 20 miles out of Heber City. This was another campground favorite of my mom and Don. There was a nice long trail that circled the campground maybe about 2 miles long. Grandpa Don would take off before the others and would place wrapped hard candy on the trail for the grandkids to find. They acted like it was a treasure hunt.</li>
                <li>Steinaker State Park and Campground – Most likely our favorite family summer outing location and the one most often selected for family reunions. Very often Judy’s parents would also participate in the outings and the two sets of parents/grandparents always tried to camp in the same two spots in the campground. This was also the chosen site for mom and Don’s cremation ashes to be spread.</li>
                <li>Jared’s Wild Rose Resort on Henry’s Lake, Idaho</li>
                <li>Henry’s Lake State Park, Idaho</li>
                <li>Hoge House in Island Park, Idaho</li>
                <li>Big Sky, Montana – Mini family reunion for two different years to enjoy the wonderful surrounding scenery and watch and cheer several members of the family participate in the scheduled mountain races.</li>
            </ol> 
        
        <h3><li>What are some of your favorite memories from your twenties?</li></h3>

            </DL>
        
        <h3><li>What was it like the first time you quit a job?</li></h3>
            <p>I can’t rightly remember the first time that I quit a job but I can remember more recent times when I have changed jobs (quit). The feelings are pretty much the same anytime that this experience happens in your life. I was always a bit fearful that feelings would be hurt especially if the job you are leaving has developed close friendships. I also usually had a feeling that perhaps I was letting the company down when I left. Perhaps a feeling of wondering if I had given the job my very best efforts while I was there. I also wondered if I would be able to use the management of the job I was leaving as a future reference. It definitely is a learning experience.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Are you still friends with any of your friends from college/early 20s?</li></h3>
            <p>After graduating from high school in June 1961 I went on to the University of Utah for my freshmen year. If any of my friends from high school also enrolled at the University of Utah it was unknown to me. So, I am not friends with anyone from college and that would include when I returned to finish my college education several years later. Judy and I were married when I was 21 and we moved to Oregon right after our wedding. We did make many new friends while we lived in Oregon but unfortunately we have not been able to maintain a relationship with any of them. We still do get together from time to time with two high school mates after we moved back to Utah in 2014.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Where were you during the moon landing?</li></h3>
            <p>I’m going to make the assumption that you are asking about the first moon landing that took place on July 20, 1969.  At this time Judy and I were living in ‘the avenues’ in Salt Lake City and I was attending the University of Utah working to finish my bachelor’s degree. Our second child, Kurt, had joined our family a year earlier on July 2, 1968. We were at this time struggling to make ends meet and, with the rest of the free world, watched this incredible feat unfold.</p>

        <h3><li>What were/are some of your favorite ways to spend a Saturday?</li></h3>
            <p>Here are a few of my favorite ways to spend Saturdays:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Serving in the Payson Utah Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints helping temple patrons perform vicarious baptisms for their kindred dead</li>
                <li>Working in our yard during the growing season to maintain grass, scrubs, trees, etc.</li>
                <li>Working in my wood shop on projects for family and friends</li>
                <li>Visiting family in and out of the state</li>
                <li>Family outings at our home or at the home of other family members</li>
              </ul> 

    </ol>

    <h1>Reflective</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Are you an extrovert or an introvert?</li></h3>
            <p>Here is one of the definitions of an extrovert: What Is an <b>Extrovert?</b> On the positive side, <b>extroverts</b> are often described as talkative, sociable, action-oriented, enthusiastic, friendly, and out-going. On the negative side, they are sometimes described as attention-seeking, easily distracted, and unable to spend time alone. Take away: I’m not an extrovert if viewed only from this definition.</p>
            <p>Here is one of the definitions of an introvert: An <b>introvert</b> is often thought of as a quiet, reserved, and thoughtful individual. They don't seek out special attention or social engagements, as these events can leave <b>introverts</b> feeling exhausted and drained. Take away: I’m not an introvert if viewed only from this definition.</p>
            <p>I’ve always thought there must be a personality trait that rests somewhere between these two extremes. Here it is: The continuum <b>between introversion and extroversion</b> captures one of the most important personality traits. ... These people (a.k.a., the vast majority of us) are called ambiverts, who have both <b>introverted and extroverted</b> tendencies. The direction ambiverts lean toward varies greatly, depending on the situation. Take away: I’m an ambivert if viewed from this definition.</p>

        <h3><li>What weaknesses do you struggle with the most?</li></h3>
            <p>So, if you were to ask Judy about my weaknesses, she could probably point out a few more. However, here are some that I know about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drinking too much Coca Cola with my cheeseburgers</li>
                <li>Not a good communicator</li>
                <li>Risk averse</li>
                <li>Too slow to change when change is needed</li>
                <li>Interrupt too often when someone else is speaking</li>
                <li>Reluctant to try new things</li>
              </ul>

        <h3><li>What is one of the greatest physical challenges you have ever had to go through? What gave you strength?</li></h3>
            <p>The first of these and by far the greatest physical challenge was summiting Mt. Rainier. Several weeks ago, I sent to you a fairly detailed description of a successful attempt to summit Mt. Rainier. I entitled it <!--link-->The Mountain.  What I only briefly touched on in that writing was how physically taxing it was for me. I had trained hard for the climb knowing that it was going to be physically challenging but it was much more so than I had anticipated. We were going to be on the mountain for most of three days and two nights so we all had backpacks that were pretty heavy. In addition, the air at that elevation is pretty thin making it a little harder to breathe especially when exerting physically.</p>
            <p>So, what gave me strength? Being surrounded by family and good friends who were willing to lighten my load on both days of the ascent. Being encouraged both by my companions and by the majesty of being on Mt. Rainier. I knew that this would be my last attempt at reaching the summit so that added some additional incentive.</p>
            <p>The second of these great physical challenges also involved climbing a mountain. However, this time it was Mt. St. Helens in Oregon. Starting in about 1991 when Joseph was just eleven years old, I had hatched a plan to take the young men of my church group on an outing and have them climb Mt. St. Helens. This was to be done just before school started each year and I hoped that if the boys could be successful in something as rigorous as this climb, they could also be successful at school. I always had several men from the church with me for these outings and we would drive and overnight part way up the mountain at a place called climber’s bivouac. The next morning, we would make the climb. The first part of the climb was really just a leisurely hike through the trees on a well-established trail. The trail ended abruptly at the tree line. After that there was no trail but boulder fields that had to be either climbed over or gone around. This went on for quite a long way up the mountain and our group started to stretch out as energies waned. There were several what we called “false summits” where you thought you were at the top only to discover that it was not the top. So far, I am struggling but keeping up somewhat with the group. However, when approaching the true summit, there is about a quarter of a mile of volcanic scree that must be crossed. This scree is almost like sand and every footstep that you made you would slide backwards, and the going was extremely tough. Part way into the scree field I had mentally and physically been drained and was about to turn around and go back down.</p>
            <p>So what gave me strength? My good friend, John Beard, was on the outing with the group and was climbing alongside me. His encouragement to keep going and staying with me until we reached the top made all the difference. It was a terrific feeling to be able to achieve a difficult task and it was only because of John’s help. This was to be the first ascent of Mt. St. Helens and for the next 10 years a group of youth and some men leaders continued to make this an annual event.</p>

        <h3><li>Do you believe in a higher power?</li></h3>
            <p>Very much “Yes” that I believe in a higher power. My name for that higher power and the name that most of the Christian world calls that higher power is Father in Heaven, his Son and our savior, Jesus Christ, and a third member of the godhead called The Holy Ghost. I would want all my posterity to know that I believe with all my heart that they exist and govern our universe. I also believe that we have a Mother in Heaven just as we have a father and mother on earth.</p>
            <p>In addition, I also believe that we lived as spirits before we were assigned to a family on earth and gained our mortal bodies. Our earth life is a kind of testing period to determine if by using our agency we can make choices that ultimately lead to helping make our world a better place to live. Fortunately, our bodies will age and our “pull dates” will be reached and we can return to our Heavenly parents and the members of our families and friends who have left mortality before us. I’m not sure how it will work in the next life, but I do believe that our family and extended family will continue in this third realm.</p>

        <h3><li>What is the farthest you have ever traveled and what is your most fond memory of that place?</li></h3>
            <p>This place would have to be Dhahran, Saudi Arabia when I was working for Aramco Services Company in Houston, Texas. The trip was made aboard a Boeing 747 jetliner that Aramco leased for moving its employees around the world. From Houston the flight made a stop at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands and then on to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The total miles covered in the flight was around 7,900 one way.</p>
            <p>My fondest memory of this place could only be the one business trip to Dhahran that Judy was able to accompany me on. Otherwise, being in this rather hostile climate of the desert does not lend itself to many fond memories.</p>
            <p>It was very enjoyable to be there with Judy and my good friend and boss at the time, Jack Rose. Judy was able to safely visit some of the bazaars in a small town just a few miles from the Aramco compound called Al Kobar.  One of the pictures that I am sending shows Judy in one of the bazaars in Al Kobar. The other photos show Judy on the Aramco compound with our friend Jack Rose.</p>
            <p>I have other experiences from my time with Aramco in Saudi Arabia but this particular visit by far carries the fondest memories.</p>

        <h3><li>Have you ever been a hero to someone? Has anyone been a hero for you?</li></h3>
            <p>The dictionary defines "hero" as "a person of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his or her brave deeds and noble qualities."</p>
            <p>There are quite a number of definitions of “hero”. However, if I were to use this particular definition, I would have to admit that I’m not sure if I would ever qualify to have been a hero to someone. I would hope so but could not name even one person.</p>
            <p>Now, has anyone been a hero for me? Absolutely! And here it is easy to name a few that have left this kind of mark on me:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Judy, my wife (lived with me and loved me since we were teenagers)</li>
                <li>Iris, my mother</li>
                <li>Blenda Snow, my maternal grandmother</li>
                <li>Cliff Snow, my maternal grandfather</li>
                <li>Donald Scott, my step-father</li>
                <li>Kenneth Zabriskie, my mentor and good friend</li>
                <li>Harold DeLaMare, my mentor and good friend</li>
            </ul>  
          
        <h3><li>Have you ever had to make a tough moral decision? How did it turn out?</li></h3>
            <p> I will not be giving specific examples to this question as it seems to me to be too personal. However, I can truly say that there have been several incidents in my life where a tough moral decision had to be made. It would seem inevitable to me that all of us humans will be faced with tough moral decisions from time to time and the way we respond to them can either strengthen or weaken our character.</p>
        
        <h3><li>How has the country changed during your lifetime?</li></h3>
            <p>Probably the most profound change has been the use of computers and to what that has led to as a by-product of its invention.</p>
            <p>Globalization – the country has gone from a self-sufficient economy in 1954 to a wide open worldwide economy. Americans can consume products from every corner of the globe.</p>
            <p>Communications (cell phones) – When I was a young boy on my grandfather’s farm in 1954 there was only one phone in the town where we lived, and it was located in Aaron’s Café. Aaron would have to send a runner to fetch someone if there was a telephone call for them. Compare that to the cell phones that almost all of us have and how easy they are to use and stay connected.</p>
            <p>Cash and Credit – From an almost totally cash based lifestyle in 1954 we now utilize credit and credit cards to a staggering proportion of our daily transactions.</p>
            <p>The Internet – the internet has basically led to a communications revolution. Its use, however, is truly a two-headed monster. It can be used for truly wonderful and uplifting projects and information while at the same time having a very possible dark side.</p>
            <p>Television – My family did not own a television set until I was in my early teens. Initially it was a black and white set and could only receive three channels. At around eleven each night all the channels would go off, the national anthem would play and then a strange pattern would appear on the set until turned off.</p>
            <p>Population growth/Divorce/Women in the workplace – The change in these areas over the past 50 to 70 years is pretty amazing and sometimes worrisome.</p>
            <p>Life Expectancy – Thanks to the tremendous advancement in medical science life expectancy has almost doubled in the last 70 years. I’m very thankful for that small miracle.</p>
            <p>Transportation – The evolution of the modern jet aircraft over the past 50 years has made Americans move across the country and the world within easy reach.</p>
            <p>Many other changes could be mentioned but this provides a good cross section.</p>
            
        <h3><li>If you had to do it all over again, would you pursue the same career path?</li></h3>
            <p>Looking back always provides an interesting perspective to a question such as this. I believe my answer would be “No”, I would not pursue the same career path. Although my career has provided well for me and my family it almost happened by accident rather than by a carefully chosen strategy.</p>
            <p>As a high school graduate, I knew that I wanted to go to college and that that was the right thing to do for preparing for adulthood, but I had no clue as to a career path at that point. Spending some time in the Air Force Reserve as an aeromedical technician gave me a glimpse of the medical profession and started me thinking about becoming a physician. So, this was pursued at university until it wasn’t because I was not dedicated enough to make that long haul happen. Consequently, other choices had to be made and life took a different trajectory and eventually led me to the career that unfolded. I really have no regrets but would still answer “No” to the question.</p>
            
        <h3><li>If you were to do it over, what would you do differently?</li></h3>
            <p>When we talk or think of hindsight we can usually see things very clearly but not at the time when things are actually happening. If I had a “do over” or a “mulligan” in golf terms, I certainly would have done some things differently and others I would do over again as they turned out nicely.</p>
            <p>I would have applied myself to my studies in high school much more aggressively and tried to determine an occupational goal much earlier on. I had always wanted to go into medicine and become a physician but I did not apply myself with the determination to make that happen. At university I was in pre-med and the courses were tough and the competition was intense for class standing. By this time we had Camille and Kurt (which I would not have changed) and both Judy and I had to work to make everything work. It seemed too hard and too long so I eventually changed direction into a business career track.</p>
            
        <h3><li>What were you doing when you were my age?</li></h3>
        <p>In May of 1961 at the age of 17 years, I graduated from Granger High School. I worked during the Summer, turned 18 on July 11, 1961, and was admitted to the University of Utah and started classes in September 1961. I continued at the “U” for my freshman year and one quarter into my sophomore year and then dropped out. Later I would return and finish my undergraduate degree and a Master’s in Business Administration. After dropping out of college I moved to Portland to live with my dad and his family. He helped get me a job with Auto Wheel Service. I worked at Auto Wheel Service for 17 months and then on December 4, 1963, I joined the Air Force Reserve and signed up for a 6 year commitment. I was immediately sent to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas for basic training and then on to Gunter AFB in Alabama for technical training as a Medical Service Specialist. I was released from active duty in May 1964 and returned to Portland. After turning from Air Force training, I renewed my relationship with Judy and we were married in September of 1964.</p>
       
        <h3><li>What do you wish you made more time in your life for?</li></h3>
        <p>Tough question but here are a few things that I wish I would have made more time for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More travel and entertainment opportunities with Judy</li>
            <li>More one on one time with each of our children</li>
            <li>More time for church service and other types of community service</li>
            <li>More time with my parents</li>
            <li>More time with my formal education</li>
            <li>More holidays together with entire family</li>
            <li>More time together with my grandchildren</li>
            <li>More one on one time with grandchildren</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><li>What is one of your favorite memories of your mother?</li></h3>
            <p>Here are a few of my favorite memories of my mother:</p>
            <p>When I was a young man and had occasion to dance with my mother, she always had to lead.</p>
            <p>Whenever we would fish together, especially in our old boat, she always had kernel corn and a can of dog food to chum the fish. Not sure it ever worked.</p>
            <p>Whenever we would have outings at Steinaker Reservoir, she would also make two or three lasagna casseroles, freeze them, and then warm them up for our dinners.</p>
            <p>My mother loved animals, especially dogs, and they were a part of her life until she could no longer take care of them because of her age.</p>
            <p>My mother loved to cook, and she was a great cook. She also loved to collect recipes and books and magazines of recipes. When we cleaned out their house in Vernal after they moved to assisted living in SLC, we found multiple boxes full of recipe books and magazines.</p>
            <p>My mother loved her grandchildren and often invited one or more of them to go with them on their camping/fishing trips.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What advice would you give your 40-year-old self?</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spend more time with loved ones and less time on my career.</li>
            <li>Commit to life-long learning, master new skills, and pick up a new hobby.</li>
            <li>Take time to exercise, meditate, walk more, and build quality friendships.</li>
            <li>Practice my craft every day but take time to make friends and have fun.</li>
            <li>Don’t be afraid to fail. Failure is always a great learning experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><li>What family tradition do you cherish the most?</li></h3>
            <p>The family tradition that I cherish the most has to be Thanksgiving. From childhood to adulthood, Thanksgiving has always involved extended family and loved ones gathering together to express thanks for their many blessings and just enjoy being together. However, here are some other family traditions that are a close second, third, . . .</p>
            <p>Christmas decorations and gift giving.</p>
            <p>Sinter Klaus (Dec 5) from our time in Holland.</p>
            <p>Birthdays and singing the Dutch birthday song.</p>
        
        <h3><li>What is your idea of perfect happiness?</li></h3>
            <p>My idea of perfect happiness would to always be surrounded by the love of my family. Regardless of the physical location of those family members, love can always overcome any physical distance between us. Being together for special occasions always adds to that love total and should be fiercely continued.</p>
            <p>Perfect happiness can also be achieved by always expressing gratitude, letting go of anger, doing what you love and loving what you do, and being yourself.</p>
    
            
        <h3><li>What is one of the stupidest things you've ever done?</li></h3>
        <p>If I had a decent memory, there would be quite a number of stupid things (mostly from my late teens or early twenties) that would make the list. But here are two that I can remember quite vividly from the stupidity that they demonstrated:</p>
        <p>After finishing my first year at the University of Utah, I moved to Portland to work and live with my Dad and his family. My dad saw to it that I had employment through the contacts that he had with the City of Portland so I had some spending money. Well with that money I purchased a 1972 or 1973 Austin Healy Sprite. It was a two seater convertible and was bright yellow. I thought for sure that it would be a “chick magnet” but instead it turned out to be a huge headache because I couldn’t keep it out of the repair shop. I limped through the summer with it being in and out of the shop most of the time and then finally decided to cut my losses and sell it. It had been a very stupid decision.</p>
        <p>The second and a much shorter explanation was letting Joseph talk me into trying to climb Mt. Rainier with him without adequate preparation and conditioning. On the day of our attempt I made it to Camp Sherman where we were to spend the night. The camp was about the halfway point of the climb. I almost immediately started to suffer from altitude sickness and it sucked out all my energy and I abandoned the climb at that point. It was a stupid decision to attempt the climb without adequate preparation.</p>
                    
        <h3><li>As you spend Christmas in 2020, looking back, what have been the most memorable Christmases and Christmas traditions that you have created?</li></h3>
        <DL>
            <DT>Most memorable Christmas</DT>
            <DD>Looking back, probably the most memorable Christmas, for all the wrong reasons, was our family Christmas of 1979. I had been promoted to a job with my company’s office in The Hague, Netherlands and we were to fly to the Netherlands in early December. Judy was pregnant with Joseph and the older children were mostly put out that we were moving but especially moving just before Christmas. We could not take many of the Christmas gifts on the plane that we had for the children and were not sure if the gifts would even make it to the Netherlands in time for Christmas. The company moved us into a small house in Wassenaar where we would stay until we could arrange more permanent housing. Everything was strange – the language, the food, the shops, how things were purchased. Judy ordered a turkey from the “meat man” and when he delivered it to our house he was holding it by its legs upside down and the head and pin feathers were still in its body. I am not sure what the children remember about this Christmas but it is still quite vivid in my memory.</DD>

            <DT>Christmas Traditions</DT>
            <DD>The Christmas traditions in my home growing up as a child and those that Judy and I have spent together since our marriage in 1964 have always revolved around these things: Christmas tree and decorations</DD>
            <DD>When we were children our mother always took enormous pride in having a beautiful Christmas tree. There were assorted Christmas decorations throughout the house but the tree was always the focal point. Her greatest pride and one that took an inordinate amount of time was to place what was called icicles (thin, long strips of aluminum colored film) on every branch of the tree as close together as possible. We boys could never have the patience to do that part of trimming the tree.</DD>
            <DD>When Judy and I were married and started our own Christmas decoration traditions, I suppose we borrowed ideas from both sets of our parents (but not the icicle idea). The early years we always had a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and other decorations throughout the house. Over the years our collection of Christmas decorations has grown until now we have to keep an inventory of the Christmas bins in the storage area on Judy’s laptop. Our home is always festive and beautiful for Christmas.</DD>

            <DT>Food</DT>
            <DD>Wonderful food and plenty of it has always been a mantra for the Davis extended family celebrations around Christmas. The main course has varied from year-to-year but it has usually been either ham, prime rib, crab or a combination of these. Crab was first introduced by my mother many years ago and has quickly gained a following in the Davis clan.</DD>
            <DD>In addition to the main course, from year-to-year there have been many special dishes. One of these special treats was what we just called “slush”. It was a concoction of bananas, oranges, lemons, sugar, and water. All mixed together in “3’s” and then frozen. It was served frozen with ginger ale or 7up poured over it for a special sweet, cold treat. The second of these special dishes was also introduced by my mother and was called “suet pudding”. This was a bread-like pudding that was served at room temperature, as I remember, but with a special sauce poured over it that I suspected had a bit of cooking brandy as an ingredient. It was very tasty.</DD>

            <DT>Family and Faith</DT>
            <DD>Christmas has always been for the Ralph & Judy Davis family a special time to celebrate and commemorate the sacred birth of the baby Jesus. Jesus Christ was a particularly special gift given to the world by a loving, caring, and concerned Father and Mother in Heaven. Sometimes with the pressure of the Christmas season bearing down on most everyone, this aspect of the Christmas season is often forgotten or becomes just an afterthought. We need to be more diligent.</DD>
            <DD>Having family around us at Christmas time has always brought great pleasure and blessings. However, as our children have aged and now have families of their own and our grandchildren are having their own families, these gatherings have become less frequent. It is inevitable that this was going to happen but we have to plan and work more diligently to continue to make these special times happen.</DD>

        <h3><li>What is your best relationship advice?</li></h3>
            <p>I’m not sure that I qualify to give relationship advice and surely what I have would most likely not be termed “best” but here it is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Love unconditionally</li>
                <li>Trust explicitly</li>
                <li>Communicate openly</li>
                <li>Respect completely</li>
            </ul>        
        
        <h3><li>What did you learn from your parents?</li></h3>
            <p>I’m not sure I could ever adequately express all that I learned from my parents. The reason being that you are always learning by watching and copying and are mostly unaware that we are learning. However, here are a few examples of things learned that I am sure of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I learned how to love animals and how to care for them</li>
                <li>I learned how to fish, camp, and take care of myself outdoors</li>
                <li>I learned how to love nature and the beauty of the world</li>
                <li>I learned how to respect and treat the women that would come into my life</li>
                <li>I learned to always do my best work even if no one would ever see it</li>
                <li>I learned to try my hardest not to hurt others</li>
                <li>I learned out important it was to always keep your word</li>
                <li>I learned that I must always try to learn from the mistakes that I made</li>
                <li>I learned how important family was and take the time to be with my grandparents and other family members, to get together often as extended family</li>
            </ul>
                
        <h3><li>What is one of your go-to stories, one you like telling over and over?</li></h3>
            <p>This story might be titled “Save the Liver”. At the time of this story, Mom and Don were living in their beautiful home in Summit Park, Utah. It was the season for the deer hunt in Utah and my brothers and I were planning on hunting together on Ferron mountain. Mom gave us very pointed instructions that if we should be lucky enough to get an animal that we were to save the liver for her.</p>
            <p>From our camp on Ferron mountain we decided to hunt “up” so that if we were lucky enough to shoot a deer it would be easier to move the animal back down to our campsite. There were still patches of snow in places on the mountain so the footing was a little slippery at times. Catching some luck we were able to take a deer early that morning quite some distance up from our camp.</p>
            <p>We field dressed the deer and after finishing we carefully wrapped up the deer’s liver and placed it inside the carcass while we made our way back down the mountain to our camp. Because of the snow in places on the mountain we decided to place a rope over the antlers of the deer and let its own weight, with the help of gravity, move it down towards our camp. Well the plan would have worked fine if the rope had not slipped from our hands and the deer went tumbling down the mountain to end up stopping near where we were camped.</p>
            <p>However, when we got down to where the deer had stopped we discovered that the liver was no longer inside the deer’s carcass. It apparently had fallen out while the deer was free-falling down the mountain. So we all started back up the slope of the mountain searching for the liver. We did not want to go home to Mom without the liver. We did find the liver after a short search and when we got back to camp we wrapped it again and placed it in the cooler. When we arrived home with the deer and its liver we proudly presented it to our Mom and then  rather sheepishly asked what her plan was for using the liver (none of us boys liked liver). She said without any hesitation “it’s for my dog”!</p>
